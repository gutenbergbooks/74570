<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This third series of the Fornander Collection of Hawaiian Folklore, in its varied
character, presents valuable features for antiquarian and ethnic students of Polynesia
in general and Hawaii in particular. The papers included in Part I, mostly the result
of S.&nbsp;N. Haleole’s researches in the work and workings of the Sorcery priesthood,
is a revelation of the power and influence of that body over the Hawaiian race in
all their vocations, and through his connections with members of the order he may
be said to have written with a clear knowledge of his subject. The opening paper on
Religious Ceremonies of the Temple came to the collection from Dr. W.&nbsp;D. Alexander,
as the contribution of Kamakau, of Kaawaloa, an eminent authority in his day, a <i lang="haw">noiau</i> (skilled in such matters), and reputed to have been a chanter of Kamehameha’s court.
</p>
<p>Part II. embraces historic studies and fragmentary notes of Judge Fornander, selected
from his miscellaneous papers, as affording an insight into his line of research work,
hence, has little of the original Hawaiian and translation feature of the other parts.
</p>
<p>Part III. is devoted entirely to chants of various kinds. These are almost wholly
from the collection of Judge L. Andrews, whose ripe Hawaiian scholarship is seen in
uncompleted translations and notes found in the collection. The “<span lang="haw">Haui ka Lani</span>” prophecy which was brought to light by Judge Andrews in the sixties and published
in part has recently been found to be entitled to three more cantos. This chant is
now believed to be complete, and appears here for the first time in translated form.
Besides this, the chants comprise eulogies, lamentations, name songs, prayers, love
songs and other meles—a valuable collection rescued from oblivion.

<p class="first">The mother being faint from unpleasant sensations, and groaning at the time, without
appetite for food, they (the attendants) sought to ascertain her cravings. Then certain
women came to her and asked, “What sort of illness have you that you hide yourself?”
She said to them, “I do not know; (I am) simply languid.” The women then said to her,
“Let’s see; we will examine you.” She took off her garment and they examined her body
while one of the women took hold of and felt of her breasts, which, on releasing the
hand, they observed the contraction of the nipples of her breasts, and exclaimed,
“You probably have a child; you are likely pregnant with one; tell us.” One of the
women said that she was simply bloated; there was no child. Another woman, however,
persisted, “You are pregnant.” They each asked her, “How many months since you last
menstruated?” “Two, since my menses period has passed.” One of the women asked her,
“What do you crave to eat?” “There is nothing that I long for. I try hard to eat.”

<p>On the third or the fourth month her pregnancy became more evident, and she realized
the truth of what the women had told her. And when it was certain that she was in
such a condition she was placed under careful restrictions; she was restrained from
eating food from any and every one if offered her. She must not eat fish salted by
others; she must not eat white fish, the <i lang="haw">aku</i>, the <i lang="haw">opelu</i>, or the mullet. She must not eat a brown-colored dog; she must not gird herself with
a glittering skirt (<i lang="haw">pa-u</i>). She was not to wear old garments; she was not to dwell in an old house; that was
strictly forbidden. Such was the manner of the teachings of the false deities.

<p>The child was thus carefully safeguarded lest the people and the chiefs sought to
kill it in its mother’s womb. A man of evil designs, if seen around such places, would
be taken before the king who commanded him to be killed. Such a place was strictly
tabooed. No woman nor man of evil intentions was to traverse there, because they had
great faith in the teachings of the false deities, and that was why a woman with a
child in her womb was kept strictly guarded.

<p>After the king and all the people heard this the king chose certain suitable persons
to rear the young chief, close relatives of his mother, of royal descent. Then the
child was placed in strict seclusion—a most sacred place—so sacred that a person who
ate pig or coconut, or any unclean or filthy food, or those whose garments were greasy
with the oil of the coconut were not allowed there. The child was not to eat out of
any old vessel which formerly contained anything filthy; it was strictly forbidden.
If a man ate pork he must die. If any woman in care of such child should eat offensive
food she should die. Thus were the chiefs and the people held in fear by the false
gods so that the child might live. As the infant was brought up and grew to childhood,
the parents conferred together, the father saying to his wife, “Our child must be
circumcised.” “Yes, if you think so,” she replied. Then the king said, “Some one go
tell the priest and see what he has to say.” And when the priest arrived in the presence
of the king, he (the king) asked him: “What would you advise? Say something regarding
the circumcision of my child.” The priest replied, “Yes, circumcise him; he has grown
so that he can slaughter a pig.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1411src" href="#xd32e1411">10</a>” (Lit., the pig is killed).

<p>And in the evening of the 29th, the king and the priest secretly buried<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1531src" href="#xd32e1531">17</a> the remains of certain things used in the service, a minor duty performed by the
priest in the temple. On the 30th, the priest sprinkled the sacred water, for the
sanctification of the temple which was such that the king was restricted from eating
the pig; he extended the restriction to the night of the 30th, and to all the chiefs
and many people. The priests and chiefs in great numbers offered prayers and praises
before the wooden idols and the feather-gods. After the prayers the king offered pig
sacrifice, calling upon the deities thus: “O Kunuiakea,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1536src" href="#xd32e1536">18</a> O Lononuiakea, O Kanenuiakea, O Kanaloanuiakea, my gods, come ye all; here is the
pig, a live pig; let me be saved by you, my gods. Here is your pig, your banana and
your coconut; save all the chiefs and all the people. Listen to my beseeching unto
you all, my gods. Seek out a sinful man and sacrifice him. Keep a righteous man and
use him well. Bless my land and preserve the people.”

<p>Thus the king worshiped the gods, and when it was night all the chiefs and the priests
of the feather-gods gathered themselves together and laid down to sleep. In the morning
all the chiefs and the multitude came forth, the priests setting the people in order
in eight rows; then the idols were placed in a row. There were many of them, about
forty or twice forty, of feather idols, and one human god, Kahoalii by name. He went
at the head of the feather-gods, and had no loin-cloth, going stark naked before the
eyes of the people. He was not ashamed before the multitude.

this was an ordinance of the <i lang="haw">alaea</i> priest. And he said to the people, “Keep quiet, all of you people and all of you
chiefs.” He then turned to the king and said: “Listen to my prayer for you. During
my supplication, if a chief interferes, he is a traitor to the land; but if a common
man he shall die for your god.”

<p>He seized his staff and prayed for a long time. The people kept very quiet before
him. At the proper time he commanded the people to arise, and said: “My brothers,
it is well; it is safe; it is accomplished;” standing up eight times and sitting down
eight times. After these things he warned the people to keep quiet and not make any
noise. And the priest turned to the king and said, “It is well.” Then they all—the
king, the priests bearing the feather gods, and the people—went into the temple to
purify themselves therein. This was an ordinance of the priest for the temple service.

<p>After this the priest uttered a prayer softly, and then turned his face to the king,
asking: “How was our prayer service?” The king answered him. “It was well.” Then the
priest questioned the king to learn if he (the king) had faithfully complied in listening
for the right or the wrong, saying: “Heard thou not the birds singing?” “No.” “Heard
thou not the crowing of the rooster?” “No.” “Did not hear a dog bark?” “No.” “Was
there not anything wrong at all with us?” “No.” “Did you not hear anything wrong at
all from the outside?” “No.” Then the priest told the king, “Your prayer was well
done, and you are saved, and your land, and the chiefs and all the people.” At the
end of their consultation, they went outside to inquire particularly what the people
had heard. And they inquired quietly: “Say, what have you heard on the outside here?”
And they whispered in reply: “Nothing, nothing at all. There was nothing wrong at
all outside here that we heard of.” Then the priest said to the king: “Your majesty.”
The king responded, “Yes.” (E o.) “I say unto you, your prayer was good, and the night
returns thanks unto you, and the deity says, ‘Thou shalt have life.’ ” They then gathered
on the outside of the temple, raising their voices, exclaiming “The prayer is flown”
(finished). And when the people heard that the king’s prayer service was ended, loud
voices were heard from all places, the exclamations of the crowd of people making
a rumbling sound, the report being carried far and wide. This was pleasing to the
king, and to the priest and the chiefs and all the people.

petitions the priest waved his hand and sat down, all joining in a prayer. The fires

the king offered to the deity a broiled pig. Only broiled pig was offered to the deity,
not roasted (in the ground). After the king’s offering to the deity, they all went

of said feather gods sang praises. When the pigs set apart for the king—they were

<p>Another priest was conducting his own services this night, this last-mentioned priest,
however, offering his prayer in the temple. This prayer was called <i lang="haw">maua</i>, an ordinance of the temple. And after midnight the king came into the temple, where
they made earnest prayer at the altar. <i lang="haw">Oihana</i> was the name of this prayer. This was a very sacred night, fires not being allowed
to burn. Then the high priest chanted these two prayers, which are <i lang="haw">piikumu</i> and <i lang="haw">leiau</i> by name.

went to conduct the service called <i lang="haw"><span class="corr" id="xd32e1807" title="Source: hooilimo">hooilimoo</span></i>, and they were silent, not uttering a word, not even moving. The priest of the order
of Lono seized a bunch of <i lang="haw">lama</i> leaves and wrapped it with a piece of white kapa. He then stood up, chanted a prayer
and sat down, continuing his entreaty; and at the conclusion of his prayer, turned
his eyes to the king. And when the king saw him looking at him, he (the king) offered
the pig in sacrifice to the god saying: “O Ku, by <i lang="haw">hooilimoo</i>;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1816src" href="#xd32e1816">26</a> here is your pig, a pig whereby I will be saved by thee. Keep careful watch over
me. Death to the traitor who takes land by force; curse him to the house of bones;
let him die.” After the king had made his sacrifice the priest turned to him and asked,
“How is our prayer?” The king answered him, “It is well.” “You did not hear anything
wrong?” “No.”

<p>After the priest had discontinued the services and had uttered a short invocation,
they passed out to the people inquiring of what they had heard. The people denied
having heard anything. This same night they all joined in prayer—the <i lang="haw">ulua</i> fishing priest, the <i lang="haw">maua</i> priest, the chief priest and the priest of the order of Lono. They continued through
this night in earnest prayer. And at dawn the priest made a sign and stood up chanting
their prayer called <i lang="haw">kolii</i>, and then sat down still praying. When this ended they raised their hands to the
<i lang="haw">lananuu</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1832src" href="#xd32e1832">27</a> from which two men were calling to them in loud voices. While the priests were chanting
from below, they (the two men) were dancing above. All this was called <i lang="haw">makii-lohelohe</i>. The king then went outside to distribute the pork to the feather idols, and the
priests, and all the chiefs, and all the people of the higher class, giving to each
feather idol its share, and also to the priests, each his share; giving chiefs of
the lower order, five-fold, and those of the higher order ten-fold, <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>while the people of the higher class received each his share, one pig to every two
companies. And the people of the lowest class after the king’s share was cooked received
their portion also. Then the king offered pigs on the altar, to the idols, about five
times forty (200) pigs. After these things they all returned to the temple—the chiefs
and all of the priests, and worshiped before the wooden idols. This prayer was called
<i lang="haw">kopili-nui</i>. The high priest then arose, offered a prayer to a fire stick and sat down. All then
prayed and many roasting fires were started burning, so numerous that the air became
heavy with the smoke of the roasting pork, from the pigs set apart for the temple
which were put on fires for broiling, the people meanwhile continued praying before
the images.

and of coconut, together with two or three men transgressors, who, after being killed,

No one was to be seen passing on the outside under penalty of death. And when he came
there solemnity prevailed on the outside, not a person passing. He came uttering a
prayer and holding a baited hook in his hand. This was the same hook with which he
was fishing during the night, and his mouth was still moving in prayer. And when he
arrived at the temple the other priests were in dread at his appearance, and fled
into the <i lang="haw">hale-pahu</i>, a place within the temple. The priest then ceased praying and spoke to the king,
saying: “Your majesty, listen to the words of god. I went out to sea last night. My
hook did not part, and my bait was not devoured. Your prayer was excellent. No traitor
shall live at thy hand. Our chief would not overcome thee.” After these words he was

<p>Early in the morning the king went to the House of Papa, to recite its prayer, together
with the priest who understood the ordinance belonging to it. They both prayed, after
which the priest said, “Listen to my words.” The king assented. “Your prayer was perfect,
and your god has looked down favorably upon you.” The king then went to his place.
Afterwards when it was daylight the king, together with the priests and the idols,
again went to the temple to offer a short prayer to the deity. After the prayer the
king offered as sacrifice to the deities, pigs, bananas, coconuts and a dead man.
This prayer was called <i lang="haw">holua</i>. The king’s feather god was then taken to the beach. It was a most sacred idol, and
wherever it went sacredness was observed and all men and all chiefs prostrated before
it. Then again the king entered the House of Papa to pray therein. Then came all the
people and all the chiefs to be blessed by the priest of Papa, so that they might
be released from any sea bathing restraint. This was the goddess who released the
temple tabu, by which the uncleanness of all the people and of all the chiefs, and

The <i lang="haw">hono</i> priest placed the people in eight rows before the altar, and in presence of the images,
the <i lang="haw">hono</i> priest officiating, said: “Remain quiet, all of you. Do not make a noise. Do not
move. Steady your posture, make the knees uniform, and keep your seats down, so that
the deity may be favorably impressed.” They obeyed the priest and behaved themselves,
not moving in the slightest. The priest then arose, shook the <i lang="haw">lama</i> branch over the people, praying alone, and saying, “The palm of the hand, raise it.”
All the people raised their hands without making any other movements, lest they might
be killed. This was a most sacred ceremony of the <i lang="haw">hono</i> priest, and an ordinance of the temple, a charge also from his ancestor to him. The
priest then gave the king his decision, saying, “Your prayer is excellent. This is
the strength of unity by which you will retain your land.” The priest then released
himself from the service, and they all left the temple, going outside to parcel out
the goods to the people and the <i lang="haw">hono</i> priest, [the goods being] pigs, bananas and coconuts. And when this was ended and

had ended these words they went on the outside in accordance with the duties of the
priest of Papa. Then all the people came together with all the chiefs and the priests,
before the priest of the House of Papa, who would release them from service and from
the temple. The king then commanded his overseer to furnish dogs for his goddess—about
forty of them—together with chickens. And when these things were brought and placed
together the priest waved a short spear (or javelin) and sat down. Then the king commanded
the priest of the House of Papa, “Get me the sash belonging to my wife, and her pig
gift to the deity.” The priest went to fetch the queen. On her accompanying him he
held one end of the sash belonging to her in one hand and the pig in the other hand,
while she held the other end of the sash behind the priest, who was chanting a prayer.
The people gazed earnestly upon her. She had fastened a white garment (<i lang="haw">pau</i>) around her waist. And when they came near to the goddess the priest ceased praying;
the queen then offered the sash and the pig to the goddess, saying: “Here is thy sash
and thy pig. My husband and I will be safe in thee, O goddess. Give us a boy child,
a beautiful image of yourself; otherwise a girl child, a pillar of white for yourself,
O goddess. It is finished.”

<p>Then came certain prophets to worship their goddess. Some for Pele, others for Hiiaka,
Kapo, Pua and Kamohoalii. There were many prophets who came this day before the king’s
goddess, where they, every one of them, offered sacrifices of goods, pigs, chickens,
and sashes, and all other things, saying: “Here are the pigs, the chickens, and the
sashes, gifts from us to thee. Save thou thy offspring; let us be strong before thee,
and let the chiefs sustain us before them; and wilt thou see that we are forgiven
on the day that we seek pardon.” They then ceased their petitions and went away. The
priest of the House of Papa then arose, waved the fire stick, sat down and prayed
to the goddesses. The fires were then started for broiling dogs and chickens; these
were brought together in the presence of the goddesses. Then the king offered the
broiled dogs and chickens. The priest of the House of Papa then exclaimed in a loud
voice over the people, saying: “<i lang="haw">Elieli.</i>”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1937src" href="#xd32e1937">31</a> The people then responded “<i lang="haw">Kapu. Elieli. Noa ia e, noho mua.</i>”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1945src" href="#xd32e1945">32</a>

<p>The temple was then quite free from <i lang="haw">kapu</i>, and the king and priest came in touch with woman and with all the people. This was
the eighth time that the king was under restriction in the temple, and he was now
free. Thus the king and priest encouraged the worship of such false deities. These
gods never uttered one word to the king and the priest, during all the time they were
in the temple, when they offered their goods as sacrifices. The deities did not do
anything for them. They themselves sang praises to the images; they themselves extolled
the deities; they did not receive any happiness from serving them. Their happiness
was not from serving them, but from their own imaginations. They were inflated with
their own pride without any idea that it was only oppression. They thought, however,
that the temple was a necessity.

it with something that he held in his hand, leaping upwards. The people then shouted
at the man’s skill. The man then touched the king with a second spear thus freeing

same crowd of people again went up the mountain, where a man would be killed. This
man sacrificed on cutting down a tree to make idols was called <i lang="haw">haalelea</i>; the people then returned from the mountain with leaves of the forest. They were
covered all over with these shrubs. These things were heaped outside of the enclosure

and the wrong. Supposing a man, or a district chief wished to build himself a house,
he must first send for the diviner to come and select a suitable site for it to stand,
and when he had chosen it he would say to the owner of the house: “Here is the location
for your house; live on this foundation until you are bent, dim-eyed, feeble and in
the last stages of life.” At the time that the house was to be built it was proper
that the diviner should be sent for to see to the mode of its erection. He had the
right to approve or condemn and pass upon it as all right. But if the diviner was
not sent for from the beginning of the work on the foundation until the completion
of the house, the diviner could come and condemn or approve.

at Nunulu in Kohala. His name was Kaili, and he was in the line of chiefs of the Kalanimoku
chain, and an uncle of Haalelea.

<p>While the missionaries were erecting their houses according to Hawaiian custom, my
guardian at the same time showed his knowledge of the order of priesthood, thus: Mr.
Bliss was the first to build his house. My guardian observed that the position of
the house was improper and the location of the building was also faulty. There were
also defects in the position of the posts. Kaili then remarked, “Had this been in
the times that have passed, this house would be [considered] faulty; the owner of
the house would not long reside [therein] before removing to another place. Not so,
however, in this new era which is under the power of Jehovah. It will not occur.”

the time therein he places his hands upon the heap of pebbles, dividing it in two,

then count the other side in the same way, and if there was no remainder, the side
of the intending thieves having the even, and the owner of the pig the odd number,

bulge being toward the next post. If the bulging is on the outside near the temporary

the hands applied; it appertained either to privation, or to the affliction of the
person crossing the hands. The adepts and those accustomed to the knowledge of the
priesthood express their interpretations as follows: If a person was walking along,
and while doing so on the road crossed his hands behind his back without a reason
for so doing, then the priest of the order of priesthood would say: “You will be found
guilty for the offense that you were complained of, because there was no cause for
your crossing your hands behind your back.” If a person had hopes to himself that
he would be exonerated before a court which made the complaint, or by any man, and
if the crossing of the hands happened through himself while on his way, then vindication
would not be obtained by him, because the omen stood for condemnation.

one of the medical priests, “rain is a good thing.” If a medical priest was called
upon to visit a person, and it was raining at the time the patient was being talked
about, it was well, and the medical priest promptly showed a willingness to go and
administer [to the sick] with a confidence that the patient would recover. There were
a few priests, however, who believed in such interpretation of the omens of the order
of priesthood; but in reference to the patient, and the cure, in the opinion of some
medical priests, rain was unfavorable to such complaint as herein mentioned.

he was called upon to visit a patient: “You go back; tomorrow I will come. If a calm
prevails throughout this night without rain then I will come; if the rain continues

which dream during sleep was unfavorable. As for example: If one intended to go fishing,
or tilling ground, or to minister unto the sick, or otherwise in relation to benefit
and blessing, if a banana dream was had in the night, then it was useless to go; no
good or benefit would be obtained by such venture because he had a banana dream. And

If a mud-hen clucked on one side, a person on the other side would surely die; and

<p class="first">Suppose that a man and his wife were living in harmony, but after a while their living
together became disagreeable, so that the wife moved to some other place and lived
there a long time, a willful desertion perhaps on the part of the wife for some <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>reason, and afterwards the husband learned that his wife had been won over by another
man; on that account perhaps he went to bring her back, but she would not return at
the time, or, if not so, perhaps the wife went to seek the husband’s return and through
such effort came together, but not long afterwards left again and went with the man
with whom she committed adultery in the first place. For this reason her own husband
became worried in mind for the child-bearing [possibilities] by this distressing desertion.
Then, in order to bring his wife back to cling to him as before, it was necessary
for the husband to summon the love-inducing priest to exercise his power for her return.
The love-inducing priest would then perform his services in accordance with the wishes
of the deserted husband, whereby she was brought back and joined him as before.

If the priest had drawn lots relating to the return of the wife, and the result was
favorable, he would explain the omen according to his knowledge; or if unfavorable,
in this manner: “We will not do anything with you because your wife will not return.”
If favorable, others would say thus: “Your wife will return; tomorrow at night your
wife will arrive at your house.” These were the words of the love-inducing priest

For example: The parting of a hook. Supposing that a person was going out fishing

the fisherman would murmur, “Those at home have transgressed.” Thus the fisherman

those at home, whether the wife or others. Therefore the parting of the hook was an

next day. If a dream of this character occurred to a person at night, of a house being
consumed by fire, its interpretation would be as follows: A charge would come forth,
perhaps an accusation liable to trial, and justly so; no good word had any reference
for this dream. If a blaze was seen in a dream, but which (blaze) had not made any
headway before it died out, then the charges would not be made public; they would
be adjusted and settled within the home. But if in the dream the blaze was seen to
spread and was not extinguished when the dreamer awoke, then the accusations would
become public, or perhaps before a trial court.

<p class="first">Throbbing of the feet is a pulsating on the under or upper side of the feet as though
of something moving. If the throbbing of the feet happened to a person at sometime
it was an indication of removal to another location at an unexpected time for removal,
therefore when the throbbing occurred a reality of the removal was apparent. However,
if the portent of the throbbing of the feet was not in this case consummated, then
it would be realized in the arrival of a stranger. Therefore this sign had reference
to two instances only, the removal to another location and the arrival of a stranger.

The conduct of the bird in running direct from the base to the end was the sign which
enabled the priest to pronounce it perfect. Where the bird traversed was the top opening
of the canoe. Supposing that the opening of the canoe which the bird apparently intended
was underneath, the bird would fly to a certain height, then circle over the tree,
the priest would understand that it was urging the turning of the tree. But if the
opening that the <i lang="haw">elepaio</i> intended to be was on the side, it would fly in that direction. On the other hand,
if the bird came and stood on the trunk of the tree intended for a canoe, if it continued
to remain there for some time, the canoe-hewing priest knew that a defect was at that
point. If the bird again ran from the trunk and stood in another place, then another
defect was at that locality, and thus the bird would indicate all the defects in the
canoe, whether it be rottenness, hollow-cored, or knotted. In this way the canoe-hewing
priest was made aware of the defects of the [tree for a] canoe.

<p class="first">Canoe-hewing priests performed an initiation service at the beginning of canoe-hewing,
but the service did not relate to priests already established. When a person desired
to learn canoe hewing he had to do as his instructor directed him. When his canoe
was completed it was essential to purchase a pig and other necessaries, which should
not be bought cheaply as in the case of other canoes. The requirements for the canoe
of a new priest being purchased cheaply depended upon the acceptance of the offering
service. In the service if the augury stood favorably, it would be apparent to the
instructor that his pupil would prosper in the vocation of canoe hewing, but if the
augury was inauspicious, then the instructor in canoe hewing would say that the pupil
could not learn the calling. If the augury foretold death then that person would surely
die if he persisted in canoe hewing; therefore it had better be left alone.

<p>Again: As the priest became cognizant of the thoroughness of the services he would
lie down on the ground and look for omens in the heavens. If the priest noticed that
the heaven was thickly covered with clouds and clear in the center, he would boastingly
exclaim: “Fish will be surrounded by the seine tomorrow; now save the salt.” But if
the priest noticed that one side of the heaven was over-clouded, and the other side
was clear, then he would say: “Tomorrow, place the canoes in the shed; let no voyages
be taken, else death will result.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5397src" href="#xd32e5397">67</a> These were the interpretations of the priest in relation to the omens in the heavens.
For if the king did not heed the words of the priest, misfortune would be the consequence.
It was better to be mindful.

earliest fisherman to those of the present time they still serve them for the success
of their vocation. Here are the names of the gods of fishing: Kuula was the husband;
Hina was the wife, and Aiai the son. Alea in Hana, Maui, was the place of residence.
During the time Kahoalii was reigning as king of Hana, Maui, with his place of residence
on the hill of Kauiki, and his fishers being the Kuula family, Kahoalii one day sent
his attendants to bring [him] some fish. This was the king’s customary practice till
he became angered at the fishermen.

the bottom with one hand, while the other holds the spear, watching for a fish to
come around, and when it does come in sight it is speared; all kinds of fish in the

are curved [forming the hook] are fitted behind the shells whereby the squid is caught.
The shell and the stone are both alike, the squid will not seize it if the stone is
not identical with the shell; the stone underneath, the shell on top. A stone is cut
to resemble the shell [in size and shape]; if the shell is spotted the stone must
be spotted, and so in all other particulars. If the stone and shell are good and exactly
alike, the squid will seize it. The man who is in the canoe shakes the line in order
to move the shell and stone, which the squid pursues to grip. If the shell is a good
attraction the catch may amount to forty squids, or perhaps a little less.

the bait are the things that catch it. When fishing, chew the kukui<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8879src" href="#xd32e8879">47</a> [nuts] and blow it on the sea to calm it whereby the bottom is made clear, and when
the squid is located the hook is let down. There are several varieties of this fish
(the squid), and it has a body which it can transform in various ways; that is why
the kukui is blown over the sea, to calm it and [permit] the squid [to be] plainly
seen. Here are the different forms of the squid at different times: In the morning
the form resembles that of breadfruit, that is, the skin. Toward noon it is red. In
the afternoon it is brown, similar to seaweed. In the evening it is dark like the
coral. All squid, both large and small, change in the same way. Therefore those who
are not learned in discerning the squid are not fit to go out on this kind of fishing.

<p>8. Flying-fish net. This is a large net, being eighteen fathoms long and six fathoms
high, and the mouth is twelve fathoms long. This is a fine-meshed net. These are the
names of the different kinds of these nets: <i>nukunuku a ula</i>, single mesh, double mesh, triple mesh. Many canoes carry this net, about thirty.
Sometimes one canoe carries the net; sometimes five, and so on. The net canoe leads
with six men aboard; the paddle-men are called “flying-fish paddlers.” The canoes
are paddled uniformly when encompassing [the fish] without one slacking backward;
when near the net the canoes are backed, then the net is drawn in. There are two canoes
allotted for receiving the fish, a younger and an elder<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9081src" href="#xd32e9081">53</a> canoe. The younger canoe is the one belonging to the net owner; the elder canoe is
that belonging to the paddle men. The tally fish belongs to the wife of the net owner.
In the net canoe there are three apportionments; the steersman in the stern of the
canoe, the paddler in the bow of the canoe, and the midship paddler. These are the
different men who share their apportionment<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9084src" href="#xd32e9084">54</a> with the net owner.

is to allure the dolphin, and when it becomes ferocious the line and hook is thrown.
When the fish bites the paddling of the canoe ceases. The dolphin is a very game fish
when caught with a hook, it is a great struggler and snorts when leaping up. A large
fish is a fathom and over, long, and a small fish is <i>muku</i> (four and a half feet). A large fish is called a <i>lapalapa</i>, also <i>ao</i>, having a breadth of a yard from the forehead to the mouth. Here are the different

at one end. The reason for that is, that when the fish is going parallel to the net
on turning back they will be caught at that place. One man splashes the sea from the
front with the paddle, to stir the sea and scare the fish. Many fishes may be caught
in this net.

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e8917src">49</a></span> In both <i lang="haw">lau</i> and bag-net fishing very fine-mesh nets are used. The <i lang="haw">lau</i> is a rope with dry <i lang="haw">ti</i> leaves—three or four—strung in it at intervals according to size. For convenience
in handling, this rope is formed of ten fathom lengths, and when the <i lang="haw">ti</i> leaves are inserted each length is called a <i lang="haw">kumu lau</i>. There may be as many as ten lengths used in fishing for <i>ohuas</i>, depending on the number of people participating, but not less than four, one being
required at each end of the <i lang="haw">lau</i> and one at each end of the net. At first the <i>kumu laus</i> are joined in the center, which point is marked by a slender stick some six feet
long of about an inch in thickness, called <i lang="haw">kuku</i>. The <i>laus</i> which up to this time have been dragged along in a bunch are then payed out from
this central point, each leader going in an opposite direction. The others divide,
half going to one side and half to the other of the <i lang="haw">kuku</i>, for the purpose of pressing down the leafed rope and at the same time pushing it
forward. Having come to the end of their respective <i>laus</i> the leaders work forward and gradually form a semicircle with the whole <i lang="haw">lau</i>. On arriving at a suitable place for laying the net, the head fisherman takes hold
of the <i lang="haw">kuku</i> and shoves it into the sand, or rock, which is the signal to stop pulling for a while.
The shock of the <i lang="haw">kuku</i> digging into the sand is felt all along the lines. All halt in their places. The
<i lang="haw">kuku</i> is then pulled out, parting the <i>kumu laus</i>, each of which is attached to the mouth of the net. The net is carried, partly dragged,
in the water by two men, who follow the middle of the <i lang="haw">lau</i> as shown by the <i lang="haw">kuku</i>. When the head fisherman signals to cease pulling awhile, the net is spread out in
position and the <i>kumu laus</i> are attached to it on either side of the mouth. At a given signal the leaders of
the <i>laus</i> come together; the <i>lomi laus</i>, those who press the leaves down, then work forward so that in a short while the
two sides form the fence to a pathway leading straight to the mouth of the net. When
the two leaders come together they press the leaves towards the net. This is usually
done by one of them grabbing the two ropes which form the fence above referred to
and bringing them together, thus driving the fish towards the net. This is the crucial
moment and has to be done quickly so as to give the fish no time to come back after
striking the net. Care must also be taken that the <i>laus</i> do not form “pockets” along their lengths lest the fish circle round in them and
dive under them. The head fisherman meanwhile watches the mouth of the net and when
no more fish appear the net is raised. In the daytime this method of fishing is called
<i>lau ohua</i>. <i>Ohua</i>, <i>puaula</i>, <i>hinalea</i>, <i>weke</i>, <i>pua oio</i>, <i>kumu</i>, <i>moano</i> and other fish which abound in moss-covered shoals are gathered. In the nighttime
this same kind of fishing is called <i>lauahi</i>. Larger fish are caught such as <i>kumu</i>, <i>puaula</i>, <i>moano</i>, <i>weke</i>, <i>nenue</i>, <i>uku</i>, lobsters and eels. Daytime fishing of the above on a large scale often going beyond
the reef into the deep sea is called <i>lau lele</i>. The method of fishing is the same but it is more laborious.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e8917src" title="Return to note 49 in text.">↑</a></p>

are going fishing they hear and run away, so that you would come back empty handed.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Don’t hold your hands behind your back. To do so is an indication of weariness and
fish, being very considerate, do not care to burden you further, so they keep out
of your reach.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Don’t carry on a conversation on the way to, or on the fishing grounds; fish would
hear and would disappear.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Don’t walk on the beach immediately abreast of where the net is intended to be cast.
The noise of your feet on the pebbles or sand warns the fish off.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Don’t ask idle questions of canoe-men getting ready to go out fishing. They consider
it an omen of bad luck.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Don’t indulge in dirty language or in smutty tales before going fishing. Even the
fish are averse to dirt.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Don’t walk on a net when it is spread out; don’t step over a net when it is bundled.
Take time to walk around it. It is the house for the fish when it is cast in the sea,
and the fish prefer it clean.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Don’t “<i>aia</i>” the fish (“there it is”), when you see it entering the net; fish are timid and do
not care to be noticed; and when you do, they turn right around and rush out again.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Don’t go fishing if your mouth is wrong (i.e., if you have made a vow which you have
not fulfilled); you will only cause weariness to your companions, for you will all
come back empty-handed. Fish abhor a gasbag and keep away from him.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e9486src" title="Return to note 72 in text.">↑</a></p>

<p>The day that the gods went out was sacred; no fires were lighted, no cultivating,
no fishing, and no other work was done. Merrymaking, pride demonstrations and going
to Hinakahua to witness the boxing were the occupations of the day. The makahiki god
led the procession, the people following behind making merry, boxing along till they
reached Hinakahua. When two men stood up to box, if one fell there were loud cheerings
and huzzas. Then the voices of derision proceeded from one side against the other,
the blows had been delivered with great force and struck the nose, the eyes, the chin;
discoloring the eye, dislocating the nose and disjointing the jaw. This was the way
they jeered at the defeated side: “Eat the manure of your chicken; the boar is biting;

any other color, if the voice was despicable and the fowl looked weighty and big-bellied,
it was called <i lang="haw">auha</i>; he would run away from his opponent after the first round, thereby called “<i lang="haw">auha</i>,” full of excrements. If the bird was of a whitish grey and the voice agreeable,
like the voice of the wild duck, and the bill black, it was a bony black bill. It
was very powerful for three rounds and long-winded during the fight. If a red bird
and slow in crowing, it was a very long-winded cock before its adversary.

swinging it around the head lash it down unitedly upon the water until the desired
undulating waves were obtained, at the same time chanting for a response to their
effort. (<i>Hawaiian Annual</i>, 1896.) Surf riding has a wider range of sport than shown above, for canoe surfing
is also very generally practiced, and occasionally body surfing. This requires strong,
expert swimmers to attain sufficient momentum to ride in on the surf without a board

<h2 class="main">Source and Migration of the Polynesian Race.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In my endeavors to throw some light upon the olden times of the Hawaiian people and—to
use a nautical expression—to “underrun” their historical cable, two questions have
ever presented themselves at the very beginning of all inquiry,—two sphinxes at the
entrance—barring the way and bewildering the traveler. They are: 1st. Whence came
the Polynesian family of tribes in the Pacific? 2d. What relation do the Polynesian
tribes bear to each other, as contemporary or successive <i>rejetons</i> from an original source, or as descendants from the descendants?
</p>
<p>Purely physical criteria refer the Polynesian family to the great Malaysian race,
but throw no light upon the question of priority between the families composing this
race. On the philological grounds, however, advanced by Dr. Rae of Hana with special
reference to this subject, and according to the origin and descent of language set
forth by Professor Max Müller, I am led to believe that the Polynesian family is vastly
older in time than the Malay family, properly so called: that is to say, the Polynesian
separated from the mother stock long before the Malay. At what period in the world’s
history the separation took place, it is now impossible to define. The language can
here be our only guide. We find then in the Polynesian dialects numerous words strongly
allied to the Sanskrit; not only in the Sanskrit of the Vedas, and as developed in
the literature of the Hindus, but to the monosyllabic and dissyllabic roots of the
Sanskrit, to the older, more primitive, form of speech, when the simple roots served
for verbs, names and adjectives, a form of speech still retained throughout the Polynesian
dialects. I am thus led to infer that the separation of the Polynesian and Sanskrit,
or rather Aryan, families of speech, must have occurred before the latter took on
the inflections which have since become so prominent a characteristic of all their
descendants.
</p>
<p>After reading Professor Müller’s “Lectures on the science of language” there can be
little doubt that the Sanskrit of the Vedas is centuries older than the time of Solomon;
that centuries more must be allowed for the development and formation of the Sanskrit,
as in the Vedas, before we reach the time when the Sanskrit or its great great ancestor
was spoken in that simplicity which it at one time possessed, when that and the Polynesian
stood together as cognate dialects of a still older speech. We know now that the Celtic,
Latin, Greek, Teutonic, Zend, Slavonic and Sanskrit were parallels, or nearly so,
dialects of an older form of speech, and that they are not descended from one another.
But that older form of speech, from which they sprung, has already assumed a system
of inflections which has remained a genealogical and hereditary characteristic of
these branches ever since, and by which their relationship has been traced back to
that older form of which there is no record extant, and for which history has no name.
To that older form I am inclined to believe that the Polynesian stood in the relation
of an elder brother or an uncle.
</p>
<p>Words may be imported into another language by conquest, commerce or intercourse,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span>without thereby indicating any generic relationship, either close or distant. Such
words are simply adopted, and become instantly subjected to the particular form and
rules which govern every other word in that language. A language may thus be overloaded
with foreign words, yet, while its pronouns, articles and prepositions remain, they
stand as living protests against the invasion of words, and point with no uncertain
light, through the night of ages, to the origin and parentage of the captive tongue.
</p>
<p>When, therefore, we find in the Polynesian dialects not only several of the Sanskrit
pronouns and prepositions, but also the very roots from which these words sprung,—not
as dead unintelligible articulations of speech, but as living sense-bearing words,—I
am logically led to believe that the connection between the two languages is generic,
not accidental; that the ancestor of the Sanskrit was at one time as simple and rude
of speech as the Polynesian has remained ever since; and that at that time the two,
and others besides, though with different dialectical proclivities, spoke one common
tongue and started in different directions from the same <i lang="la">officina gentium</i>.
</p>
<p>If I were permitted to indicate the route of the Polynesian family, after it separated
from its Aryan cousins in the highlands of middle Asia, I would say that it descended
into Hindostan; that in course of time it was followed by the Tamul family from the
northeast who drove the former out of India and were in their turn driven into the
lower part of the Peninsula by the now Sanskrit speaking Aryans. When driven out of
the Peninsula the Indian Ocean received the wanderers. Of the transit through India,
and of the length of the sojourn there, no record or trace exists, unless the Polynesian
goddess Hina,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11554src" href="#xd32e11554">1</a> or Sina, as it is pronounced in some dialects, bear some relation to the land of
<i>Hind</i> or Sind, as it was called by the Sanskrit and Zend speaking peoples.
</p>
<p>The next traces of the Polynesian family, after their expulsion from Hindustan, are
found in two very different directions; in the Battas, Buguis and Iduans of the Malay
Archipelago to the east, and in the Malgasse of Madagascar to the west. When they
arrived in these new habitats, and how long they remained unmolested in the former,
can now only be a matter of mere conjecture. It is fair to conclude, however, that
they continued on their eastward route while yet their language retained its original,
liquid purity, and before the Batta, <span class="corr" id="xd32e11564" title="Source: Begui">Bugui</span> and other remnants assumed the harder, consonantal terminations of words, with which
the Malay dialects are strongly impregnated, and which are entirely foreign to the
primitive Polynesian dialects as found in the Pacific.
</p>
<p>In the Malay language there are two words to designate an island, <i lang="ms">nusa</i> and <i lang="ms">pulo</i>. <i lang="ms">Nusa</i>, however, seems to have been by far the older expression, and <i lang="ms">pulo</i> only obtained at a comparatively later time when the Malay branch proper of the Polynesian
family became the predominant people in the Asiatic Archipelago. In none of the Polynesian
dialects does the word <i lang="ms">pulo</i> occur to designate an island. I infer hence that its adoption and use in the Malay
Archipelago is subsequent to the departure of <span class="pageNum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>the Polynesians for the Pacific. The word <i lang="ms">nusa</i> as an appellative of an island occurs in several instances among the Pacific-Polynesian
groups: among the Paumotus, Marquesas, Tokolau or Union and de Peyster’s groups, and
also in the Viti Archipelago, which has received the nomenclature of a great number
of its islands from Polynesian sources. It always occurs in compound words as names
of islands; e.g., Nuku-hiwa (Marqu.); Nuku-Nono (Union Gr.); Nuku-fetau (de Peyster’s);
Nuku-tawake and Nuku-ti-pipi (Paumotu). In the Hawaiian group no island or islet,
that I am aware of, bears that appellation, but in the Hawaiian legends the land from
which their ancestors came, and which they are frequently said to have visited, is
called Nu’u-mehelani—the Nu’u being a contraction of the Nuku of the South Pacific
dialects.
</p>
<p>When I said above that the Polynesian family were probably driven out of Hindostan
by the Tamul family, and found a refuge in the Asiatic Archipelago, some remnants
of the family undoubtedly remained on the mainland; for we find in the traditionary
annals of Sumatra, that the Malays proper derive themselves from Hindostan, whence
they arrived at Palembang under the leadership of a son of the Rajah of Bisnagour.
Such an emigration, and others like it, doubtless started the older Polynesians further
eastward. And as they went, they gave their names to places, bays, headlands, and
islands, many of which names have remained to this day and mark the resting places
where they stopped, the route by which they traveled. One of the Moluccas is called
“Morotai.” Now this is a purely Polynesian name, by which one of the Hawaiian Islands
is called (Molokai-a-Hina), recalling thus not only the name of a former habitat,
but also the birth-place of their ancestors. In the <i lang="fr">Histoire de la Conquête des Isles Moluques</i>, by d’Argensola, vol. III (Amsterdam, 1706), we are told that the Moluccas were formerly
called “Sindas” by Ptolomy, especially Amboyna, Celebes and Gilolo,—Molokai-a-Hina
refers itself then at once to Morotoy de los Sindas according to the early Spanish
navigators.
</p>
<p>In the island of Timor there is a place and bay called Babao. The name occurs again
in Vavao, one of the Tonga or Friendly Islands, and in Mature-wawao on the Acteon
Islands of the Paumotu group. One of the Loyalty Islands is called Lifu. That name
occurs again in “Fefuka,” one of the Hapai group in the Friendly Islands. It occurs
also in “Lehua,” one of the Hawaiian Islands. On the Island of Uea, another of the
Loyalty group, is a headland called to this day by the Papuan or Melanesian inhabitants
the “Fa’i-a-Ue,” but this is a purely Polynesian word which rendered in the Hawaiian
dialect would be “Pali-a-Ua,” or, as there may be a doubt as to the proper orthography,
“Tai-a-Ue” (house or dwelling of Ua), a word readily intelligible to a Polynesian,
but without sense or meaning to a Papuan. In Celebes and in Borneo are two independent
states, inhabited by Buguis and Dyaks, called “Ouadjou” or “Ouahou” (according to
French and English orthography), proto-names of the Hawaiian island “Oahu.” The traditions
of the Tonga Islands point to a land in the northwest called “Pulatu,” as their fatherland,
and whither their spirits returned after death, the residence of their gods.
</p>
<p>The absence, however, in the Polynesian language of any name for, or of any image
or memory of, the ox, the horse, the sheep, would seem indirectly to indicate that
that separation took place before these animals were domesticated by the mother-stock
<span class="pageNum" id="pb225">[<a href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>and its other descendants, or that they were living at the time of separation in a
country where those animals were unknown.
</p>
<p>History is almost equally mute as to the place where this separation took place. Some
faint traces alone remain, in the names of headlands and islands, of the routes by
which they entered the Pacific, and some of the Polynesian traditions point to a land
in the northwest, called “Pulo-to” as their fatherland and whither their spirits returned
after death. Mr. <span class="corr" id="xd32e11603" title="Source: Dominis">Domeny</span> de Rienzi, in his <i lang="fr">Océanie</i>, affords many plausible reasons for assuming that Borneo is the father-land and starting
point of the Polynesian family, and that it springs from the Daya or Dyak root. If
so, the separation took place before the Daya language took on the consonantal endings
to so many of its words.
</p>
<p>How the separation took place there can be little doubt about. Wars and famine have
in the past as in the present even impelled mankind to seek in distant climes that
security and abundance which were denied them at home.
</p>
<p>Assuming therefore—and there are but small grounds for doubting the correctness of
the general proposition—that the ancestors of the Polynesian family were driven out
from their original home in the Asiatic Archipelago by their cousins german or, rather,
nephews, the present Malay tribes, properly so called, there were two passages by
which they might escape into the unknown (if they were unknown) wastes of the Pacific:
either by the Gilolo Passage or by Torres Straits. I am inclined to believe that the
greater stream came by Torres Straits, though others might have come and undoubtedly
did come by the Gilolo Passage, and that they dwelt some time on the Loyalty Islands
before they were driven further on by the Papuan race which now occupies them. My
reason for so thinking is that the names of these islands and some of their prominent
headlands, even in the mouth of its present inhabitants, are purely Polynesian names,
and thus indicate the prolonged if not previous presence of the race that named them.
From the Loyalty isles they undoubtedly touched at and occupied portions of the Viti
Archipelago, which have ever since remained a debatable ground between the Papuan
and the Polynesian races. Hence to the Samoan group in the northeast, and to the Tonga
group in the southeast, the transition was easy; and these I believe to have been
the first permanent habitats of the Polynesian family in the Pacific. Whether these
two groups were settled simultaneously or successively, or the one from the other,
would require more special knowledge of their respective traditions, legends, songs
and language to decide, than I possess. And from one or the other of these groups
the other Polynesian islands have been peopled surely. I am inclined to believe, however,
that the Samoan, or Navigator’s Islands were the first permanent footholds which the
Polynesians obtained in the Pacific. My reason for so thinking is this: In the Daya
dialects—among the Battas, Idaans, Buguis, and Soulas, or rather Houlas, the <i>s</i> is a component part of the language. The only Polynesian dialect which has preserved
the <i>s</i> in the same words and in the same places of a word is the Samoan. All other dialects
have substituted an aspirate for the sibilant,—<i>h</i>, <i>k</i> or <i>t</i>. In the same manner the <i>ng</i> is a consonant sound in the Daya, Bugui and Batta dialects. It is the same in the
Samoan; and although still retained in the Tonga, Hervey and New Zealand groups, it
is but sparsely used and decreasing in frequency in the Tahiti, Paumotu and Marquesan
groups, and disused entirely in the Hawaiian group; <i>p</i> and <i>k</i> being its general substitutes.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span></p>
<p>Other indications of the relationship of the Polynesian and Aryan races are not wanting
to those who are more competent than I am to pursue the comparison. The Greek “Ouranos”
is evidently a congener or descendant of the Polynesian Rangi or Lani (Heaven). I
am inclined to think that the name of “Siwa,” one of the Hindu Trimurti, owes its
origin or finds its explanation in the Polynesian word “hiwa,” primarily “dark-colored,
black or blue,” secondly “sacred” as a sacrificial offering—though I am unable to
say why the dark-colored, black or blue should have been considered sacred, unless
we take the Anglo-Saxon “Hefen” or “Heofen,” the elevated firmament, the heaven, the
dark-blue sky, as an explanation offered by a cognate dialect. In the Samoan, “Siwa,”
in the Tahitian, “Heiwa,” signify dancing; but in all the Polynesian dialects the
idea of sacredness underlies and characterizes the derivative meanings. Thus Nuku-Hiwa
(one of the Marquesas Isls.), undoubtedly meant originally “the dark, or sacred island,”
Fatu-Hiwa, “the sacred rock or stone;” and in Hawaiian we find the same expression
in Puaa Hiwa, “the sacred hog” offered in sacrifices. In the Hindu Trimurti the figure
of Vishnu is represented in a black or blue color, and thus we find that the same
idea of sacredness was by the Sanskrit speaking Hindus attached to that color, as
by the Polynesian tribes. The Hindu gods “Varuna” and “Vhani” find their etymological
solution and origin in the Polynesian (Tah.) “Varua” and in the Haw. “Uhane,” both
signifying “spirit,” a ghost. In the Sanskrit “Saka” was a distinctive appellation
of kings, chiefs and lords. I am not aware that any such single word in the Polynesian
dialects expresses that meaning, but we find it in a compound form in the Marquesas
dialect as “Haka’iki,” Haka-a-iki, a chief. The Polynesian word “ariki” (chief) itself,
undoubtedly springs from the same root as the Latin “rego,” to rule,—the Gothic “reiki,”
dominion,—the Saxon “rie,” noble, (see comparative catalogue of words in the Polynesian
and Aryan families of speech).
</p>
<p>I am, further, disposed to believe that the Polynesian family left India before the
Brahma religion attained its full development among the Sanskrit speaking Aryans.
There undoubtedly were certain modes of thought, certain customs, common to both,
but I have reason to believe that they were anterior to the establishments of Brahmanism,
[The Polynesians were not acquainted with the Hindu Trimurti. They had a Chamurti,
if I may use the expression, a quaternity of gods—Kane, Ku, Kangaloa and Lono or Ro’o,
the latter however being the son of Kangaloa, and some others who were born of <i>Po</i>, the night, chaos, but their attributes were indefinite and promiscuous,] and their
worship did not harden into a religious system or cult until long after their settlement
in the Pacific. They retained the original idea of the Suttee, for with them it was
not limited to the wives of a deceased, but embraced the dearest and best beloved
friends of either sex; and instead of being obligatory it was optional among the relatives
and friends, and only obligatory upon the slaves and dependants. Their division of
castes show no derivation from the Brahman arrangement. The latter, at first, consisted
probably only of three, the Brahmans, Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas; the Sudras being a
subsequent division: the Polynesians placing the Kshatriyas, the warrior caste, the
<i>ariki</i> first; the Brahmans, the priesthood, the <i>kahuna</i> second; and the <i>menehune</i> or <i>makaainana</i>, the Vaisyas, the commonalty or plebs last. It is natural, and more conformable to
the development of the actual society of savage people, that valor or manhood <span class="pageNum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>should assert and assume the preeminence of rank over that of intelligence, and I
hence conclude that the Polynesian division was older than the Sanskrit.
</p>
<p>How long the Polynesian family remained in the Asiatic Archipelago ere it debouched
in the Pacific, there is no means of forming even a conjecture. We only know that
it must have left before its remaining congeners and cousins, in the course of the
phonetic corruption of a once common tongue, commenced to add consonants to the endings
of their words, or to eliminate vowel sounds, thus bringing two consonants together.
Its reminiscences of that period are not many, with the exception of the identification
of names of places. Its practice of tatooing (tatau) was either brought with it from
India, or was adopted there. “Milu,” the Polynesian (Haw.) Pluto, god of the infernal
regions, below the sea, where departed spirits went, according to some traditions,
calls to mind Mount Miru (Gounoung se Miru), the sacred mountain in Java and first
settlement of the Hindus in that island under Tritestra or Aji-Saka, about A.D. 76,
although the name of the mountain may be as properly found in the Hawaiian adjective
<i>Milu</i>, grand, solemn. The anthropophagism of some of the Polynesian tribes did probably
receive its earliest development and confirmation during their sejour in the Malay
Archipelago, and it is yet practiced by those of their kin who remained, such as the
Battas, the Idaans and others. When they left India this horrible practice had probably
not gone farther than the drinking the blood of a slain enemy, a practice common with
the Rajpoots in northwestern India and some other of the older, if not aboriginal,
tribes of that country.
</p>
<p>I believe however that the Polynesian family did not leave the Asiatic Archipelago
before Brahmanism had been introduced there. And although the Polynesians never adopted
either Brahmanism or Buddhism as a creed, yet they carried with them and retained
among their traditionary lore not a few of the ideas to which Brahmanism gave birth
and circulation. The earth being created from an egg, referred to by Ellis as a Hawaiian
tradition, is a Brahmin dogma. The different versions of the flood, current among
the Polynesian tribes, north and south, had their probable origin in the Brahmin legend
of Satyuorata, the seventh Manu, who alone with his family escaped the deluge that
destroyed the rest of mankind.
</p>
<p>The story of the fountain of youth and life—the “wai-ola-loa a Kane”—if not of Brahmin
origin, was widely upheld by them, and was well known—<i lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i>—to the Polynesians. The arrangement of the calendar into twelve months of thirty
days, with an intercalary month points strongly to a Brahmin-Malay original. The use
of the betel or areca nut, though practised by many of the Papuan tribes and probably
introduced among them by the neighboring Malays, or vice versa, is unknown to the
Polynesian family. How old that custom may be among the Malays I have no means of
ascertaining; but I infer that the Polynesians left for the Pacific before it was
adopted. The resemblance and conformity of usages, customs and modes of thought, between
the Polynesians and the Dayas, Battas, Buguis and other tribes still living in the
Malay Archipelago, and which I look upon as remnants of the Polynesian family, are
too many and too striking not to indicate a close relationship, a common origin, and
a lengthened period of residence in the same place, to give time for their development
and spread.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the <i lang="fr">L’Univers</i> or <i lang="fr">Océanie</i> by G.&nbsp;L. <span class="corr" id="xd32e11665" title="Source: Dominis">Domeny</span> de Rienzi this subject and its bearing upon the relationship of the Polynesian and
the present Daya tribes and their connections in Malaysia is fully and well treated.
The Malays and Javanese, who arrived in the archipelago at a later date than the above
tribes, also attest their priority by calling them the “Orang Benoa,” aborigines of
the country.
</p>
<p>Another indication of the Polynesians leaving the Malay Archipelago <i>after</i> the establishment of a Hindu empire and Brahmanism in that archipelago, seems to
me to be found in the name “Sawaii,” “Hawaii,” “Havaiki,” as it is differently called
in different Polynesian dialects. The word Hawaiki, used by the New Zealanders, the
Tongas, the Hervey, some of the Paumotu and, I think the Northern Marquesas, is undoubtedly
the oldest form of the word, that form—with the dialectical difference of <i>s</i> and <i>h</i>—which the Polynesians brought with them from Malaysia. But Hawaiki is identical with
Djawa-iki or Jawa-iki (little Java) the <i>j</i> or <i>dj</i> sound being convertible into <i>h</i>, as evidenced in the names of other places and words common to the Polynesian and
Malay tongues. Previous to the establishment of the Hindus in Jawa, that island was
called Nusa-Kindang,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11683src" href="#xd32e11683">2</a> as reported in Javanese annals; after that establishment the name was changed to
Nusa-Jawa. That event is by Javanese annals fixed at about 76 A.D. Those Hindus came
from the country of Kling or Talinga on the west coast of India, and were probably
of the Malay stirps, great-grand-nephews, so to say, of the long antecedent Polynesians.
It was but natural that in their new habitats in the Pacific the latter should employ
the nomenclature of their former homes, as we actually find it to have been the case
in numerous instances.
</p>
<p>Having then ascertained with a considerable degree of probability, as I think, that
the early Polynesians, who settled in the Pacific, came from India through the Malay
Archipelago, passing out by the Gilolo Passage or by Torres Straits, and most likely
the latter, the question may arise, how came they to push past the entire Papuan Archipelago,
some thousands of miles into the Pacific, before they established themselves in their
new homes? That question involves a consideration of the origin and habitats of the
Papuan race which I do not feel competent to engage in. This much, however, can be
established; that at some remote period the Papuans inhabited the islands of the Malay
Archipelago as far west, at least, as Borneo and probably extended up into Anam, Siam
and Burma; that as the Malayo-Polynesian race advanced to the eastward, the Papuans
were driven before them, either out of the islands altogether, or into the interior
of the larger ones, where remnants of them still are found. Thus expelled from, or
conquered in the Malay Archipelago, the Papuan furnished them an asylum and a home,
unless we assume that they had already spread so far east before they came into hostile
contact with the Hindu-Polynesians in the west. When, therefore, the latter were in
their turn crowded out by the encroachments of the later Hindu-Malayans, and left
from various points of the archipelago—from Sumatra to Timor—entering the Pacific
in quest of new abodes, they found their ancient foes in superior force along their
route, and unable to effect permanent settlements along the Papuan islands, they were
obliged <span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>to push on eastward until the Polynesian islands, at that time uninhabited, afforded
them that shelter and rest which in vain they had sought on the Papuan coasts.
</p>
<p>That their first attempt at permanent settlements, after a precarious and unsuccessful
sejour at the Loyalty Isles, was at the Viti or Fiji Islands there can be little doubt.
The number of Polynesian names by which these islands and places in them are called,
even now, by the Papuan inhabitants, argues, if not wholly a priority, at least a
permanence of residence, that can not well be disputed. The mixture of the two races,
especially in the southeastern part of the Viti Archipelago, indicates a protracted
stay and an intercourse of peace as well as of war. But after some time—how long can
not now be expressed in generations or in centuries—the Papuans succeeded in driving
the Polynesians out of their group, and then, if they had not before, they occupied
the island groups still further eastward, simultaneously or successively. Of that
intercourse, contest and hostility between the Papuan and Polynesian races on the
southwest fringe of the Pacific there are several traditionary reminiscences among
the Polynesian tribes, embodied in their mythology and connected with their earliest
data, or retained as historical facts pointing to past collision and stimulating to
further reprisals. The Tonga Islands have a tradition, recorded by Mariner, that Tangaloa,
one of their principal gods, had two sons, of which the elder was called Tupo, the
younger, Vaka-ako-uli. The first was indolent and shiftless, the other industrious
and prosperous. Jealousy induced the former to kill the other. Then Tangaloa called
the older brother and the family of the younger before him and thus addressed the
latter: “Your bodies shall be fair, as the spirit of your father was good and pure;
take your canoes and travel to the eastward and all good things attend you.” And to
the older brother the offended god thus spoke: “Thy body shall be black, as thy soul
is wicked and unclean; I will raise the east wind between you and your brother’s family,
so that you cannot go to them, yet from time to time I will permit them to come to
you for the purposes of trade.” When we consider that from earliest times the Tonga
Islanders have kept up a constant intercourse with the Viti group, either warlike
or commercial, it is not difficult to apply the tradition or to point the moral.
</p>
<p>That the hostility in the early days of Polynesian settlement in the Pacific was remembered
by other tribes as well as the Tonga, and looked upon as a national vendetta, may
be inferred from a remark made by Quiros in his account of the expedition of Mendana
(1595), while at the island of Santa Christina (Tahuata) in the Marquesan group. He
says:—I quote from <i lang="fr">Voyage de Marchand</i>, vol. I, p. 227,—that the natives, having observed a negro on board of the admiral’s
ship among the Spaniards, said that to the south of their island there was land inhabited
by black men; that they were their enemies; that they used the bow and arrow; and
that the big war-canoes then lying in the bay of Madre de Dios, were destined and
being fitted to make war upon them. Quiros, not then knowing the existence of the
Viti group, discredited their story of the black men. The specialty, however, of their
using the bow and arrow points them out as the Papuans of the Viti group, to whom
that weapon was and is familiar, while by the Polynesians generally it is never or
seldom used for purposes of war.
</p>
<p>Whether the Marquesans at that time actually carried on so distant a warfare as between
their group and the Viti, may or may not be called in doubt; but the fact, that <span class="pageNum" id="pb230">[<a href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>they were acquainted with the existence of the Papuan race in the Pacific, as distinct
from their own, and with their peculiar weapon of war, and that that acquaintance
was one of ancient and intense <span class="corr" id="xd32e11701" title="Source: hosility">hostility</span>, I think cannot be doubted.
</p>
<p>In a recent work,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11706src" href="#xd32e11706">3</a> Wallace argues very ingenuously that the Polynesian race is merely a modification
of the Papuan race, superinduced by an admixture of Malay or some light-colored Mongol
element, the Papuan, however, largely predominating, physically, mentally and morally,
but that such admixture probably occurred at such a remote period as, through the
lapse of ages, to have become a permanent type. He further asserts that the presence
of a decided Malay element in the Polynesian languages is altogether a phenomenon
of recent occurrence originating in the roaming habits of the chief Malay tribes,
and says that this fact is proved by the presence of a number of actual modern Malay
and Javanese words and not more Malay roots, as would have been the case had their
introduction been as remote as the origin of a very distinct race; and he concludes
by saying that there are proofs of extensive migration among the Pacific Islands,
but there are no proofs whatever of recent migration from any surrounding country
to Polynesia, since there are no people to be found elsewhere sufficiently resembling
the Polynesian race in their chief physical and mental characteristics.
</p>
<p>With these propositions, I cannot agree. Wallace evidently classes the Battas, Dayas
and Buguis as Malays,—Malays of the modern generally received type. Independent of
traditional and historical proofs to the contrary, it does not seem to have occurred
to him that those Battas, Buguis and Dayas, though from the same mother stock as the
modern Malays, are an infinitely older off-shoot than the latter, and so regarded
by them: that the Malays, instead of descending through Burmah, Siam and Malacca,
claim for themselves a Hindu descent from the eastern coast, the country of Kling
and Telinga; and that when they emigrated from that grand <i lang="la">officina gentium</i> the Malay Archipelago was already in possession of the Battas, <span class="sic">Dyas</span> and Buguis and their other congeners and contemporaries, of which I claim the present
Polynesian family to have been one. He overlooks moreover the fact that the traditions,
customs and language of those very pre-Malay occupants of the archipelago, from Sumatra
to Celebes and Flores, Savu, Rothi and to some extent Timor, in a most remarkable
degree point to central and northern India as their cradle and their source. He asserts
that the Polynesian has a greater physical, mental and moral resemblance to the Papuan
than to the Malay, and that <i>ergo</i>, he is, as regards origin, entirely distinct from the latter and merely a modification
hardened into a variety of the former. Had the author studied the remarkable differences,
physical, mental and moral, which characterize some of the European families now known
to be descended from the same source—the low-browed, turned-up-nosed, large-mouthed,
boisterous Celt, and the square-browed, aquiline-nosed, reserved Roman—he may have
concluded that the Aryan descendants to the east would have been as diversified in
their national and tribal development, as those to the west; and that the same law
of variation would operate on the one side as on the other. His remarks—that the Malay
element in the Polynesian languages is a recent phenomenon originating in the roaming
habits of the Malays, and that that element<span class="pageNum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>—instead of being composed of Malay roots, pointing to a remote origin,—is actually
proven by the presence of a number of modern Malay Javanese words,—may very probably
apply to the western Papuans, but are void and unsustained, if applied to the Polynesians
proper of the East and South Pacific. So far from the Malay element being a modern
intrusion into the Polynesian, the latter has not only preserved many of the older
forms of speech of the common Malay, but in the words which are common to it and its
congeners, the Battas, Dayas and Buguis, the Polynesian form is generally the purest,
oldest and the least affected by phonetic corruption.
</p>
<p>As to there being “no proofs whatever of recent migration from any surrounding country
to Polynesia,” it might be well to understand at the outset what is meant by the word
“recent.” Is it applied in its limited sense conveying the idea of a few generations
or a few hundred years; or is it applied in a comparative sense, in which an event
one or two thousand years ago may be called recent when compared with other events
of a still more remote age? If the former, there certainly are no proofs of a recent
migration from any surrounding country, inhabited by a kindred race, that could account
for the arrival and spread of the Polynesian in the South and East Pacific; if the
latter, the physical, mental and moral resemblance of the Polynesian to the pre-Malay
occupants of the Asiatic Archipelago, his traditions, customs and language, prove,—inferentially
it is true,—but prove beyond a doubt his migration from that archipelago and his kindred
with its former possessors, as much so as the Celt, the Greek, the Goth and the Slav
can be proved to have descended from the same stock in the west, that gave birth to
the Hindu, Daya and Malay families in the east.
</p>
<p>As regards the first settlers of the Hawaiian Islands, I am led to believe that they
came from the Samoan group, through the Tahiti and Marquesas Islands; in other words,
that the Tahitians came from Samoa, the Marquesans from Tahiti, and the Hawaiians
from the Marquesans. The Marquesans have legends and traditions which pretend to describe
their wanderings in olden times, but the Hawaiians have none but that their gods came
from Tahiti. But where history and tradition fail, I hold that the gradual and phonetic
corruption of the language will in a great measure indicate the halting places of
those who speak it. We find then in the Tahitian that the Samoan <i>ng</i> is replaced with <i>n</i> and the <i>s</i> dropped or replaced with <i>t</i>, while the <i>f</i> and the <i>t</i> are retained. On proceeding to the Marquesas we find that, with the exception of
some of the southern islands, <i>ng</i> and <i>f</i> have been replaced by <i>n</i> and <i>h</i>, and that the <i>k</i> sound has become as prominent as the <i>t</i>. Arriving at the Hawaiian group we find not only <i>s</i>, <i>ng</i>, and <i>f</i> repudiated <i>in toto</i> and replaced by <i>h</i>, <i>n</i> or <i>k</i>, and by <i>h</i> or <i>p</i>, and that <i>k</i> has become the predominant sound instead of <i>t</i>, but we find also the Tahitian causative <i>hoa</i> softened to <i>hoo</i>; we frequently find the <i>k</i> eliminated from between two vowels or at the commencement of a word where it is retained
in the other dialects; we find words obsolete in the Hawaiian which still pass current
in the other dialects with original or derivative meanings. We can thus trace the
people by the phonetic corruption of their language, as, I have no doubt the Samoan
(not in the present, but in its original form) could be traced by competent philologists
to that primordial source from which both the Turanian and Aryan languages issued.
</p>
<p>At what period in the world’s history the first Polynesian settlers discovered <span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>and occupied the Hawaiian Islands, it is now impossible accurately to define. Ethnologically,
we can trace them backward to India; historically, we can not trace them even to their
last point of departure, the Marquesas or the Society Islands. That they are of the
same race that now inhabit the eastern and southern parts of Polynesia is beyond a
doubt. That that race was settled in the Asiatic Archipelago centuries before the
Christian era, I believe to be equally certain; but whether the emigration into Polynesia
took place before the Christian era, or was occasioned by the invasion of the forefathers
of the Malay family from India about the commencement of that era, there is nothing,
that I am aware of, either in Polynesian, Malayan or Hindu traditions to throw any
light upon. In Hawaiian tradition, there is no distinct remembrance, and but the faintest
allusion to the fact that the islands were inhabited while the volcanoes on the leeward
islands were still in an active state. It is impossible to judge of the age of a lava
flow by its looks. Portions of the lava stream of 1840, flowing from Kilauea into
Puna district of Hawaii, were in 1867 covered with a luxuriant vegetation; while older
flows in Puna, of which no memory exists, the last flow from Hualalai in 1791 or 1792
through Kekaha on the west of Hawaii, and the flow near Keoneoio in Honuaula, Maui,
called Hanakaie, which is by tradition referred back to the mythological period of
Pele and her compeers, look as fresh and glossy today as if thrown out but yesterday.
</p>
<p>Geologically speaking, the leeward islands are the oldest in the group and, with the
exception of the legends of Pele and Hawaii Loa, there is no trace or tradition in
the popular mind that their volcanoes had been active since the islands had been inhabited.
But both on Molokai and on Oahu human remains have been found imbedded in lava flows
of undisputed antiquity and of whose occurrence no vestige of remembrance remains
in song or saga.
</p>
<p>In 1859, Mr. R.&nbsp;W. Meyer, of Kalae, Molokai, found in the side of a hill on his estate,
some seventy feet beneath the surface and in a stratum of breccia—volcanic mud, clay
and ashes—of several feet in thickness, a human skull whose every cavity was fully
and compactly filled with the volcanic deposit surrounding it, as if it had been cast
in a mould, evidently showing that the skull had been filled while the deposit was
yet in a fluid state. As that stratum spreads over a considerable tract of land in
the neighborhood, at a varying depth beneath the surface of from ten to four hundred
feet, and as the valleys and gulches, which now intersect it in numerous places, were
manifestly formed by erosion—perhaps in some measure also by subsequent earthquake
shocks—the great age of that human vestige may be reasonably inferred, though impossible
to demonstrate within a period of one or five hundred years preceding the coherent
traditional accounts of that island.
</p>
<p>Hawaiian traditions on Hawaiian soil, though valuable as national reminiscences, more
or less obscured by the lapse of time, do not go back with any historical precision
much more than twenty-eight generations from the present (about 1865), or say 840
years. Within that period the harbor and neighboring coast-line of Honolulu has remained
nearly what it now is, nor has any subsidence, sufficient to account for the formation
of the coral-pan in that place, or subsequent upheaval been retained in the memory
of those twenty-eight generations.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb233">[<a href="#pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p>I am tolerably safe, then, in asserting that these islands were inhabited 800 or 900
years ago, and had been inhabited for centuries previously, by the same race of people
that inhabits them now.
</p>
<p>Professor Max Müller, in his Lectures on the Science of Language, has shown it to
be very probable that in the 12th and 13th centuries before Christ the Tamul family
had already been driven into Deccan and the southern parts of the Hindu Peninsula
by the invading Aryans. With due attention to the course and character of those waves
of migration, it becomes also very probable that the Polynesian family had by or before
that time been driven into the Asiatic Archipelago, displacing in their turn the Papuan
family. How soon or how long after that occupation the first adventurous Polynesians
debouched into the Pacific, it is impossible to even conjecture. But we know that,
about the commencement of the Christian era, new swarms of emigrants from middle and
eastern India invaded the area occupied by the Polynesians and spread themselves from
Sumatra to Timor, from Java to Manila, expelling, subjugating or isolating the previous
occupants.
</p>
<p>Taking this epoch as the starting-point for the appearance of the Polynesian in the
Pacific, we have an interval of time of 900 to 1000 years, in which to people the
various islands and groups now held by the Polynesian family, and before we meet the
uncontested Hawaiian traditions which assure us that twenty-eight generations ago
this group was already peopled by that family.
</p>
<p>Among the Hawaiian genealogies, now extant, I am, for reasons which will hereafter
appear, disposed to consider the Haloa-Nanaulu-Maweke line as the most reliable. It
numbers fifty-seven generations from Wakea to the present time, twenty-nine from Wakea
to, and including, Maweke, and twenty-eight from Maweke until now. Fifty-seven generations,
at the recognized term of thirty years to a generation, makes 1710 years from now
up to Wakea, the recognized progenitor and head of most of the southern and eastern
Polynesian branches—or, say, A.D. 150, which would in a great measure correspond with
the invasion and spread of the Hindu-Malay family in the Asiatic Archipelago. It became
known to, and was acknowledged, however, in the time of Kamehameha I, by his bards
and genealogists, that the first thirteen names on the Haloa line, to Nanaulu, were
shared in common with the Marquesan and Tahitian branches of the Polynesian family.
These then must have existed before the occupation of the Hawaiian Islands, which
would leave sixteen generations or about 480 years in which to discover and people
the islands previous to the era of Maweke and his contemporaries—the Paumakua of Oahu,
the Kuheailani of Hawaii, the Puna family of chiefs on Kauai, the Hua family on Maui,
the Kamauaua family on Molokai, and others. By which of these sixteen generations,
from Maweke up to Nanaulu, the islands were settled upon there is nothing positively
to show. The historical presumption, however, would indicate Nanaulu, the first of
these sixteen, as the epoch of such discovery, and there exists still a Hawaiian tradition
connected with the name of his grandson, Pehekeula, a chief on Oahu.
</p>
<p>We get, then, the following leading propositions as chronological sign-posts, approximately
at least, of the Polynesian migrations in the Pacific: 1. During the close of the
first and the beginning of the second century of the present era, the Polynesians
<span class="pageNum" id="pb234">[<a href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>left the Asiatic Archipelago and entered the Pacific, establishing themselves on the
Samoa and Tonga groups and spreading eastward and northward. 2. During the 5th century
Polynesians settled on the Hawaiian Islands and remained there comparatively unknown
until 3. the eleventh century when several parties of fresh immigrants from the Marquesas,
Tahiti and Samoa groups arrived at the Hawaiian Islands, and for the space of five
or six generations revived and maintained an active intercourse with the first-named
groups and the mother-stock.
</p>
<p>It is rather singular that while most of the principal groups of the Polynesian family
claim, each for itself, the honor of being the first-created of mankind and, so to
say, autochthones on their respective islands—as the Tonga, Samoan, Society and Hawaiian
Islands—with the exception of the legend of Hawaii Loa, the Marquesans alone own to
a foreign birthplace and a migration from a far-off land. In the meles and legends
collated and preserved by Mr. Lawson, a resident of Hiwaoa, Marquesan Islands (and
now held in MS. by Professor Alexander of Punahou College, Oahu, Hawaiian Islands),
mention is made of a number of lands or islands, on which they successively stopped
in their migration, ere they finally reached the Marquesan Islands, or, as they are
called by them, the Ao-maama. According to these, the Marquesans started from a land
called Take-hee-hee, far away to the westward from the group they now occupy; and
the name by which they call themselves is “<i>te Take</i>.” There are two accounts of their wanderings after being driven out of Take-hee-hee.
One mentions thirteen places of stoppage before they arrived at Ao-maama, the present
Marquesan Islands; the other account mentions seventeen places before their final
settlement on the last-mentioned group. During all these migrations the <i>Take</i>, or Marquesan people represent themselves as coming from <i>below</i> (mei-iao) and going <i>up</i> (una). Throughout the Polynesian groups, however, within the tropics, when a land
is spoken of as <i>iao</i>, <i>ilalo</i>, <i>iraro</i> of the speaker’s place, it invariably means to the leeward, before the prevailing
trade-wind. This being from northeast or southeast, these migrations pursued a course
from west to east, and thus corroborate the Polynesian descent from Asia or the Asiatic
Archipelago.
</p>
<p>That the Polynesians, during their sojourn in India or the Indian Archipelago, had
received no inconsiderable share of the culture and civilization which the ancient
Arabs, through their colonies and commerce, had spread over these countries long before
the Vedic branch of the Aryans occupied Aria-warta or had crossed the Ganges,—there
is much in their legends, customs and religions to denote. Whether that culture was
received however, while in India or in the Archipelago, it is now impossible to decide.
That those old-world Arabs, those Cushites of the Indian records and of Holy Writ,
had, long before the Vedas were written, controlled the ante-Aryan peoples of India
and its Archipelago, and moulded them to their own usages and religion is now, I believe,
an admitted fact by antiquarians and ethnologists. That that culture and those usages
were greatly modified by the subsequent occupation and predominancy—temporal and spiritual—of
the Aryan race, and that that, in its turn, was reacted upon by the previous Arab
or Cushite culture, there are numerous proofs in the Hindu writings. Hence that mixture
of myths, that jumble of confused reminiscences, which stock the legends and load
the memory of the Polynesian tribes. Monotheism, zabaism, polytheism and <span class="pageNum" id="pb235">[<a href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>fetishism were inextricably mixed up in their religious conceptions, and while the
two latter were the ordinary practice of everyday life for, at least, the last thirty
generations of their abode in the Pacific, yet glimpses of the former were retained
in their memory and hoarded as deposits “mai ka Po mai”—from a hoary antiquity—by
their kilos, kaulas and kahunas (prophets and priests). Hence their diversity of worship:
some tribes making Kanaloa, some Kane, some Kali, some Atea the chief of their deities
and the originator of all things. Hence some tribes continued the Arab practice of
circumcision, while others did not. Hence the Arab institution in social life of independent
yet confederated communes among some tribes, while the monarchial or feudal system
obtained among others. Hence the Arabic type of truncated pyramids in the shape of
their temples, side by side with the Hindu practice of promenading their god in gorgeous
processions. Hence while the Arab doctrine of a primal chaos is retained by nearly
all the Polynesian tribes, some still retain the Braminical doctrine of the World-egg.
So far as I am acquainted only one of the Polynesian tribes designates itself by a
national name, other than that of the habitat or country which they occupy, and that
is the Southern Marquesans. They call themselves the nation or tribe of the Take—<i>te Take</i>. Now this word, allowing for the Polynesian pronunciation, is identical with <i>Tasi</i>, an ancient national name, by which Iranian writers designated the Arabs of Southern
and Eastern Arabia, from Yemen to Irak-Arabi; and their progenitor was called “Taz,”
probably representing “Tasm,” one of the twelve original tribes of the old Cushite
race, according to Arabian traditions. The name occurs again in Thas-os, an island
in the Ægean, off the coast of Thrace, which, according to Herodotus, was colonized
by the Phœnicians and called after their leader Thas-us. This Phœnician origin and
name connects it with the great Cushite family in race and language of which the Phœnicians
formed so conspicuous a branch. The same word occurs again in “Desi,” a name by which
the Sanskrit writers designated the language of the people who occupied India before
the Aryans entered it. This word occurs again in “Dasyus,” a name by which the Sanskrit
speaking Aryans designated the non-Aryan population of India, who were also called
by them “Rakshasha” and “Mlechcha,” the latter of which words still survives in the
Polynesian <i>maloka</i> and with the same meaning—impious, profane—as in the Sanskrit.
</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the plateau of Moldi, opposite the Island of Massua, on the coast
of Abyssinia, being of the pure Greek race and speaking the Tigrai dialect of the
old Ethiopian, are called <i>Khasi</i> by the Arabs, signifying “unaltered, pure.”
</p>
<p>The word <i>take</i>, as expressing a nation or race, exists in other Polynesian dialects under the form
of <i>tae</i>, <i>tai</i> or <i>kai</i>, which in the Marquesan itself is used interchangeably with the former. Thus we find
Ani-tai and Ahee-tai for Anitake and Ahee-take. In the Tonga group <i>tai</i> is a common expression to designate a race, people or generation—<i>Kai-Fiti</i>, Viti people, <i>Kai-Tonga</i>, Tonga people, etc. In Hawaiian we find <i>Kakai</i>, a family including servants and dependents.
</p>
<p>In the Hindu legend of Arachandran,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11849src" href="#xd32e11849">4</a> the perfect man, it is said that when he had been tormented and tried and driven
out of his kingdom, he started to go to the country <span class="pageNum" id="pb236">[<a href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>of Kasi, on the Ganges. The “Khasi” in Abyssinia, and the “Kasi” on the Ganges were
both of Cushite origin. Again, in the Polynesian legends reference is made to a country
called Kua-i-helani and a king of that country called Iku or Aiku who had twelve children,
whose adventures and exploits are fully related in the legend of Aukelenuiaiku. Now
we know from Indian lore that, far off in the prehistoric times, a famous king ruled
over Arabia and upper Egypt whose name was It or Ait, and whom the Greek traditions
called Aetus.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11854src" href="#xd32e11854">5</a> We know that before the Aryans entered India, and long after, they called the country
between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf by the name of “Cusha-dwipa,”
and that the same extent of country was by the Semite Hebrews called “Cush.” These
words in Polynesian pronunciation would infallibly become either “Kua” or “Ku,” the
suffixed “Helani” being merely an epithet of grandeur and glory.
</p>
<p>Again, Oro or Koro, of the Society and Hervey groups, was the terrible God of War,
on whose altars human sacrifices were offered. He was the son of Kangaloa, the principal
deity of these groups. His name and attributes forcibly recall Horus the son of Osiris
of Egyptian traditions and <i>uro</i> the Egyptian hieroglyphic name for king, as well as Hor the invincible War-God, from
time immemorial, of the Raypoots in Northwestern India. “<i>Gourou</i>” or “<i>Goro</i>,” moreover, is an old Indian and Javanese word for deity in general, and its modern
meaning is “a religious instructor.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11866src" href="#xd32e11866">6</a>
</p>
<p>Unless, then, we concede the origin of the Polynesian family to have been, proximately
in the Asiatic Archipelago, more remotely in India, as one perhaps of the many branches
of the Dravidian family, certainly as one of the ante-Aryan peoples living there and
being more or less impregnated with the Arab blood and culture which in these early
days controlled India, the Indian Ocean and all the coasts and islands near it, from
Mozambique to Japan,—unless we concede this, Polynesian myths, songs, traditions and
customs become unintelligible, and the people itself becomes an historical puzzle,
an ethnological accident.
</p>
<p>In one of the Marquesan legends or religious chants of the creation of the world—<i>Te Pena-pena</i>—by the God Atea, the then known world extended from Vavau to Hawaii, “<i lang="haw">me Vavau i Hawaii</i>;” and after the earth was made or, rather, brought to light, the order was given:
</p>
<div lang="haw" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Pu te metani me Vevau
</p>
<p class="line">A anu te tai o Hawa-ii
</p>
<p class="line">Pu atu te metani me Hawa-ii
</p>
<p class="line">A anu te ao o Vevau.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">(Blow winds from Vavau and cool the sea of Hawa-ii; blow back winds from <span class="corr" id="xd32e11888" title="Source: Hawaii">Hawa-ii</span> and cool the air [or the region] of Vavau); and the burden of each stanza or act
of creation is
</p>
<div lang="haw" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">O Vevau me Hawa-ii.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Again in the chant of the Deluge, it is said that after the flood the ribs of the
earth <span class="pageNum" id="pb237">[<a href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>and the mountain ridges of Hawaii rose up and extended far and near over the sea of
Hawaii
</p>
<div lang="haw" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Una te tai o Hawaii.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The question now arises where and what were this “Vevau” and “Hawaii,” which constituted
the boundaries of the world when this chant was composed?
</p>
<p>I have already stated that the large bay of Coupang, on the Island of Timor, was formerly
called Babao. This bay and surrounding country was, at the time of the European settlements
there, an independent state and kingdom, and it is highly probable that in ancient
times, before the Malay element preponderated in the Indian Archipelago, it might
have given its name to the whole island, inasmuch as that name is found in the nomenclature
of islands, districts and places which the Polynesians carried with them into the
Pacific and adapted to their new habitats. But Babao is and would be Vavao or Vevao
in any of the Polynesian dialects, for they have no letter <i>b</i>. If I am right in this, it becomes intelligible why Vavao or Timor should have been
quoted as the one terminus of the known world to the people then occupying the archipelago
from there to Java or Sumatra. To those people, at that time, it was the eastern-most
land then known, and, when the Malay element assumed the preponderance in the archipelago,
it was called “Timor” or “The East,” plainly indicating that it was also by them at
that time considered as the extreme east.
</p>
<p>I have already stated that I consider the Polynesian word <i>Hawaii</i> as corresponding to, or representing the word <i>Jawa</i>, as applied to the second island of the Sunda group. From the pronunciation of the
word in the different Polynesian dialects I was led to believe that its original name
in Polynesian mouths was “Hawa-iki” or Little Jawa. It is possible, however, that
it may also have been, as pronounced in some dialects, <i>Hawa-ii</i> or <i>Sava-ii</i>,—the raging furious (as applied to volcanic mountains) Hawa or Sava or Saba. How
far this name was applied to the western islands of the Sunda group I am unable to
say. We know that Ptolomy, the geographer, designated Sumatra as “Jaba-din.” It may
therefore very probably in times anterior to him have included a portion or the whole
of the latter island as well as the present Java. Be this as it may, the frequent
allusions made in the chant referred to, to the sea of Hawaii (<i>te tai o Hawaii</i>)—the Jawa sea, points with sufficient accuracy to this island as the western terminus
of the world as known to those who composed that chant.
</p>
<p>In this way the expression used in the chant regarding the wind receives a force and
application, which under no other construction it could have received. It then applied
to the regular monsoons which blow over that part of the world: “Blow wind from Vevao
(from the east) and cool the sea of Hawa: blow back wind from Hawa (from the west)
and cool the region or air of Vevao.”
</p>
<p>The Hawaiian appellations for the same cardinal points, while they differ in name,
tend to the same result. In the Hawaiian group the North is called, among other names,
“Ulunui,” “Uliuli,” “Hakalauai,” “Melemele,” but these are known by tradition to have
been names of lands, situated to the north of some former habitat of the people, of
which all knowledge and remembrance was lost save <span class="corr" id="xd32e11920" title="Source: that that">that</span> they were situated to the north of them, and were visited at one time by that famous
voyager, whose exploits <span class="pageNum" id="pb238">[<a href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>survive in song and saga, Kaulu-a-Kalana. Among the names for the South occurs that
ancient one of <i>lipo</i>, also of <i>lepo</i>. The former signifies blue, black or dark, and hence the deep water in the sea; the
latter is synonymous with <i>moana</i>, the deep open ocean. Now, there is no land to the north of the Hawaiian Islands
within reach or ken that could have suggested these names as cognomens or epithets
for the North, while <i>moana lipo</i>, the dark, bottomless ocean, approaches them not on the south only, but on every
side. Those names, therefore, bespeak a foreign origin, and that origin I hold to
have been in the Sunda Islands. No other configuration of land can account for it.
</p>
<p>Though none of the above statements, singly, amounts to a positive proof, yet, taken
together, I think they furnish sufficient induction to warrant the conclusion that
the Polynesian family in the Pacific, from New Zealand to the Hawaiian group and from
Easter Island to the outlying eastern portion of the Viti Archipelago, is descended
from a branch that was agnate to, but far older than, the Vedic branch of the Aryan
race; that it had entered India long before the Aryans; that, while there, it became
moulded to the Cushite-Arabian civilization of that time and more or less mixed up
with the Dravidian branches, who either were in India before it, or entered there
from the northeast; that, whether driven out by force or leaving for colonizing purposes,
it established itself in the Indian Archipelago at an early period and spread itself
from Sumatra to Timor, from Borneo to Manila; that it was followed into this archipelago
by Brahmanized Dravidians and other tribes from Deccan who, in their turn, obtained
the ascendancy and drove the Polynesians to the mountains and the interior of the
larger islands or compelled them to leave altogether; that no positive time can be
assigned for leaving the Asiatic Archipelago and pushing into the Pacific—it may have
occurred centuries before the present era, but certainly was not later than the first
century of it, or thereabout; that the diversity of features and complexion in the
Polynesian family—the frequent high forehead and Roman nose and light olive color—attest
as much its Aryan relation and Cushite connection, as it does its intermixture with
the Dravidian and Malay branches before and subsequent to leaving India; and that
if the present Hindu is an Aryan descendant, the Polynesian is, <i lang="la">a fortiori</i>, an Aryan ancestor.

<h2 class="main">Traditional Hawaiian History.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I have read with a great deal of interest the efforts made by various writers in the
Hawaiian journals to restore and to publish the traditions, histories, songs and sagas,
pertaining to the Hawaiian people. They have a value and being far greater than many
would at first conceive of, whether historically, ethnologically or philologically
considered; and their preservation and critical collation and analysis are objects
well worthy of the time and trouble of men of leisure and ability. I have every reason
to believe that what has so far been published is but a small part of the material
that may yet be collected, if proper inquiries were made. It would be as absurd and
incorrect to date Hawaiian history from the time of Captain Cook, as it would be to
date English history from the time of the Norman Conquest, while the previous national
life of the Hawaiian people is laid bare to the critical observer in numerous <i>meles</i>, <i>kaaos</i>, and <i>moolelos</i>, preserved and handed down from generation to generation, not by foreign dilettante
or men of no standing, but by the most jealous care of chiefs, priests, and bards,
independent in their source and preservation, crossing, clashing or confirming each
other. Though the historical thread which underruns these traditions is often overlaid
with fables, superstitions and exaggerations, yet I contend that from the very nature
of their independent sources they are a most valuable material from which to rehabilitate
Hawaiian history for centuries anterior to Capt. Cook. The critical canon which refuses
to build up history from tradition, and receives nothing but contemporary writers
or monumental records as evidences of fact, seems to me more nice than wise under
certain circumstances. When <span class="corr" id="xd32e11950" title="Source: Niebhur">Niebuhr</span> ran his pen through Roman history previous to the sack of the city by the Gauls,
it was not on account of the worthlessness of the Roman traditions, for he never had
them in their pure and simple archaic form, nor yet a trust-worthy translation of
them in either Greek or later Latin, but only such as the prejudice, credulity, ignorance
and uncritical manipulation of Troy, Dionysius of Halicarnassus and others, had made
them. And I am fain to believe that had either <span class="corr" id="xd32e11953" title="Source: Niebhur">Niebuhr</span> or Sir Cornwall Lewis stood face to face with the Roman, Etruscan and Sabinian traditions
in their original, unadulterated form, while yet presenting a living impress of their
respective peoples, so far from rejecting, they would have turned them to the best
account in elucidating the times of which they treated.
</p>
<p>Now as regards Hawaiian traditions, we have, or may have—if proper and speedy means
are taken before the present generation of quinquagenarians becomes extinct,—a number
and various series of traditions, genealogies, songs, histories, tales, prayers, rites
of worship, land divisions, social and economical rules, agricultural and maritime
instructions, all of them in the original language, bearing intrinsic and unmistakable
proofs not only of their genuineness and great age, but also of different epochs of
composition; and all of them issuing from and attached not to one grand overshadowing
dynasty of chiefs to whose vanity, ambition and pretensions they might have been made
subservient,—but to three, four, sometimes five or more equally independent rival
dynasties, scanning each <span class="pageNum" id="pb240">[<a href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>other’s claims and <span class="corr" id="xd32e11960" title="Source: pretentions">pretensions</span> with jealous care and asserting their own with the fullest freedom.
</p>
<p>Of the almost incredible tenacity and faithfulness with which these traditions were
preserved and handed down, abundant proofs exist in the uncorrupted exactness with
which they are repeated even at this late day, when collected and written down as
delivered by the old people in various parts of the islands. I have two independent
sets of the prayer and chant of “Kapaahulani” (“<span lang="haw">He Elele kii na Maui</span>”), recounting the genealogy and exploits of Kualii, a famous King of Oahu,—one collected
on Hawaii, the other on Oahu—and yet—though it is perhaps the longest poem in the
Hawaiian language, having six hundred and eighteen lines—the two versions do not differ
to a word; so tenacious was the memory, so faithful the preservation of the original
composition. I have also a double version of the remarkable chant or prophecy of Kaulumoku
(“<span lang="haw">O Haui ka lani</span> etc.”) regarding Kamehameha I, composed years before the conquest of the islands
by the latter, and containing five hundred and twenty-seven lines; one version collected
on Maui, the other on Hawaii, and the only difference between the two is the omission
of one line in the Hawaii version. Though parts of the first poem are evidently of
older date than the others, yet the poem as a whole can not well, from merely genealogical
consideration, be less than two hundred years old. The latter poem was evidently composed
before the year 1786, the approximate date of the author’s death, while Kamehameha
I was still ruling over only one third of Hawaii and struggling with no marked success
against the combined forces of Keawemauhili and Keoua. And thus with many other meles
and chants of much older date, bearing record of contemporary events and of the past
reminiscences of this people.
</p>
<p>It is historically on record that a Spanish vessel under Capt. Gaetano, sailing from
Acapulco to Manila, did about the year 1542 discover certain islands in the North
Pacific, corresponding in latitude to the position of the Hawaiian Islands, though
over ten degrees too far east in longitude; and that one of them, thought to be Hawaii,
was called La Mesa by the Spaniards. But that record, and no subsequent or preceding
record yet known in the Spanish archives, make any mention that these islands were
ever visited by the Spanish navigators.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11973src" href="#xd32e11973">1</a> Here the native tradition comes to our aid; and that tradition is clear and positive
and was well known before the arrival of Captain Cook, and is in substance this, that,
in the time of Keliiokaloa, the son of Umi-a-Liloa, a vessel was cast away on the
southwestern coast of Hawaii and three persons were saved from the wreck, viz: two
men and one woman, who were kindly received and remained the balance of their lives
in the country, marrying and having children with the aborigines. The first question
which arises is, when did Keliiokaloa live? We know from numerous native genealogies,
original on different islands, attached to different dynasties and families, crossing
and confirming each other, that Keliiokaloa was the eighth generation previous to
the birth of Kamehameha I. Now Kamehameha I died in May, 1819, and was at his death
about eighty years old, making the time of birth approximate to the year 1740, perhaps
one or two years earlier. Deducting the generation of which Keliiokaloa <span class="pageNum" id="pb241">[<a href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>was one, seven generations are left between the time of the shipwreck (and landing
of the foreigners), mentioned in the tradition, and the birth of Kamehameha I.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11978src" href="#xd32e11978">2</a>
</p>
<p>Whether that arrival of foreigners of European extraction was the only one which occurred
during the time that the Spaniards monopolized the navigation in the North Pacific,
I have found nothing positive in the native traditions, to either affirm or deny;
though I have inferential reasons to believe that others besides those alluded to
above did touch at some of these islands. In the well-known <i>pule</i> or chant of Kapaahulani, the King of Oahu, Kualii,—who during some portion of his
life at least was contemporary with Keawe, the great grandfather of Kamehameha—is
made to say of himself that he knew Tahiti. I quote the verse as it has been handed
down:
</p>
<div lang="haw" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Ua ike hoi wau ia Tahiti,
</p>
<p class="line">He moku leo pahaohao wale Tahiti.

</div>
<p class="first">At the time when Kualii lived and ruled, (say 1675 as the central epoch of his exploits,)
the visits and excursions of the Hawaiians in their own canoes to foreign lands had
been discontinued for many generations, and, while the memories of former journeys
were kept green in numerous families, yet since the days of … no song nor saga records
such journeys by the boldest and bravest of Hawaiian heroes, until this avowal of
Kualii stands forth in its solitary grandeur, awakening discussion on the following
points:—1. Which was the Tahiti that Kualii visited? 2. Did he visit it in his own
vessel, canoe or <i>peleleu</i>, or was he, like Kaiana in after years, taken away by a foreign vessel and returned
by the same?
</p>
<p>1. To the Hawaiian people, in their own language, <i>Tahiti</i> means generally a foreign country,—a country outside of and beyond their own group.
When reference is made in the Hawaiian songs and sagas to any of the Tahitis with
which they had frequent and intimate intercourse up to a certain period, the particular
Tahiti is generally specified with some special epithet affixed, as Tahiti-ku, Tahiti-moe,
Holani-ku, Nuumealani, Holani-moe, Lulokapu, etc., but these and others, representing
islands to the south and southwest of this group, are nowhere spoken of as with a
<i>leo pahaohao</i>—an entirely different language—not different in dialect, but different in kind. When
therefore Kualii about the middle or latter part of the seventeenth century speaks
of the Tahiti which he visited as being a country with a <i>leo pahaohao</i>, he did not and could not <span class="pageNum" id="pb242">[<a href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>mean any of the Central or South Polynesian Islands. Moreover, when he says that he
there saw the “haole”—the white-skinned man—the inference is plain that it was not
a Tahiti inhabited by kindreds of his own race; for the South Pacific Tahitis had
not then been taken possession of, or settled upon by Europeans. The probability therefore
is strong that the Tahiti he refers to was either the western coast of Mexico or Manila
where the Spaniards were settled and held possession.
</p>
<p>I have no doubt that the ancient Hawaiians had a knowledge of the mainland of America—at
present Mexico or California—and that they designated it under the rather indefinite
appellation of <i>Kukulu o Tahiti</i>—the farthest ends of foreign lands;—but that knowledge was acquired before that coast
was occupied by the Spaniard, for the meles and legends which refer to it make no
mention of the “haole” up to the time of Kualii.
</p>
<p>2. How did Kualii get to Tahiti? The intercourse between this group and other groups
of Polynesia or the American mainland of which the older meles speak so frequently,
had ceased many generations before Kualii’s time, and Hawaiian navigation was then
limited to the seas and islands comprising the group. Even the Kauai rovers, noted
as the most daring and skilful throughout the group, had lost the knowledge or the
means of going to Tahiti. I have shown that Kualii lived within the period when the
Spanish-Manila trade from the Mexican coast was at its height. It is historically
on record that the Spanish discovered this group about 1542; it is traditionally on
record that Spaniards (for no other foreigners or “haoles” then navigated the North
Pacific) were cast away on Hawaii within a range of twenty years, above or below that
period; and there are reasons for believing that more than one galleon, during the
time of the Spanish monopoly of the Manila trade, either visited the islands directly,
or went so near to them as to be able to pick off any natives who might have been
at sea in their canoes at the time of the passing of the galleon.
</p>
<p>Though Hawaiian tradition is silent as to the manner in which Kualii visited Tahiti
the land of the “haole,” it is positive as to the fact; and the only reasonable explanation
I can offer is that a Spanish galleon in passing these islands picked up Kualii, at
sea or ashore, voluntarily or as a hostage, and returned him on its next trip. And
what was thus done in one instance, and of which tradition has been retained because
the object of it was one of the highest chiefs in the country, whose renown in after
times filled the land from one end to the other, may have occurred in other instances
before or since with men of lesser note of whom tradition is silent or has been lost.
</p>
<p>Probably the best informed Hawaiian archaeologist of the present day is S.&nbsp;M. Kamakau,
but even he is often very credulous, inconsistent and uncritical. He has published,
through the various newspapers, several genealogies of the ancient chiefs, but beyond
the time of Umi-a-Liloa of Hawaii, Piilani of Maui and Kaihikapu-a-Manuia and Kakuhihewa
of Oahu, his love of antiquity often lead him into irreconcilable difficulties. For
instance, when Lauli-a-laa, the son of Laamaikahiki, who is forty-sixth from Haloa
on the Ulu and Puna-imua line of descent, is represented as having married Maelo (w),
daughter of Kuolono, and who is thirty-fourth on the Nanaulu straight line from Haloa,
there is evidently either a large gap in the Nanaulu line or a corresponding increase
by the insertion of collateral branches in the Puna-imua line. When Kelea, the wife
of Kalamakua, the thirty-ninth on the Nanaulu straight line, is represented as the
sister of Kawaokaohele, <span class="pageNum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>the fifty-sixth on the Hema and Hanalaaiki line, the same discrepancy appears. The
Kauai genealogies, which I have received from Hon. D. Kalakaua, make only forty-five
generations from Wakea, through the Nanaulu-Muliele-alii-Kumuhonua-Elepuukahonua line,
to Kamakahelei and to Kumahana who were contemporaries of Kamehameha I, the sixty-fourth,
if not the sixty-fifth from Wakea through the Ulu-Hema-Hanalaanui line. The Kauai
genealogy makes Kualii the forty-third from Haloa, whereas the Oahu genealogy, through
Moikeha, the brother of Kumuhonua, makes Kualii the forty-ninth from Haloa; the discrepancy
lying between the thirty-first and thirty-eighth of the Kauai-Elepuukahonua line.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12027src" href="#xd32e12027">4</a>
</p>
<p>From comparing the various genealogies, sagas and meles it becomes evident that the
time of Maweke’s sons and grandsons, on the Nanaulu straight line, was a time of great
and general convulsion. It was the Homeric period of Hawaiian history. This was the
period of grand enterprises; of voyages to and from Tahiti. This period is the principal
starting point of most of the Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, and some of the Maui and Hawaii
genealogies; and Maweke is the only line which keeps the correlation of its branches
in any way consistent and conformable, not only to their natural relation, but also
to traditional evidence and to historical requirements.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12035src" href="#xd32e12035">5</a>
</p>
<p>It is well known to tradition and recorded in songs and sagas that before the time
of Pili-Kaaiea there was a vacuum in the Hawaii-Hanalaanui-Hema line of aliis, and
from the antiquarian lore of S.&nbsp;M. Kamakau, throwing light on the ante-“Pili” period,
I am forced to conclude that at least seventeen generations, as quoted in the Hema
genealogy of the Hawaii chiefs, must be thrown out in order to make subsequent well-known
generations fall into their places as indicated by the Oahu, Kauai or Molokai lines
of descent from Maweke and his sons. Thus when all the traditions and meles make Kaaipahu
the forty-ninth on the recognized Hawaii-Hanalaanui-Hema line, the husband of Hualani,
the great-great-granddaughter of Keaunui-a-Maweke and thirty-third on the Nanaulu
line, then inferentially but effectively confirm the statement of Kamakau of the displacement
of the seventeen generations interpolated on the Hawaii line, either immediately preceding
Pili, or between Ulu and Aikanaka. At any rate it makes Pili,—who, it is well known,
arrived from Tahiti with Paa and became the founder of the new and later line of Hawaii
aliis—contemporary with the grand period of migrations recorded in the meles and sagas
of the sons and successors of Maweke.
</p>
<p>The Maui-Hanalaa-iki line must suffer a similar curtailment in order to bring its
prominent historical figures in consonance with Oahu and Kauai genealogies. Thus when
all accounts agree in making Kelea, the sister of Kawaokaohele of Maui and aunt of
Piilani, the wife of Lo Lale—brother of Piliwale of Oahu—there can be no doubt of
their contemporaneity. But the Oahu-Nanaulu line makes Lo Lale the thirty-ninth or
forty-first from Wakea, and the Maui-Hanalaa-iki line makes Kelea the fifty-sixth
from Wakea, thus showing the same irreconcilable difference of from fifteen to seventeen
generations as we encountered in the Hawaii-Hanalaa-nui line.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb244">[<a href="#pb244">244</a>]</span></p>
<p>I am further more inclined to consider the Oahu-Nanaulu straight line of descent as
the most correct and reliable, inasmuch as I find it corroborated by an examination
of nearly all the correlative branches originating from the children and grandchildren
of Maweke, the twenty-eighth on the Nanaulu line from Wakea. Thus the line of Kalehenui-a-Maweke,
culminating in Kaakaualani, the wife of Kakuhihewa, corresponds exactly with the line
of Mulielialii-a-Maweke ending in Kakuhihewa. Thus the line of Keaunui-a-Maweke, through
Nuakea, Kalahumoku, Moku-a-Hualeiakea, to the children and grandchildren of Umi-a-Liloa
in Hawaii, the uncontested contemporaries of Kakuhihewa, is equally full and correct.
I am therefore inclined to consider the Nanaulu line, including its branches, not
only as the most correct, but as the main trunk of Hawaiian genealogy. And that it
was so considered by the ancient Hawaiians themselves, I infer from the evident and
repeated desires of the Hawaii and Maui chiefs to connect themselves with the Kauai
and Oahu branches of this line, and by the fact that Kauai was looked upon by them
as the cradle of knowledge, skill, laws and religion.
</p>
<p>Between the different genealogies, as I have received them, the following discrepancies
appear, which in my opinion, indicate either gaps in one line, or additions in another.
There are certain luminous points of coincidence or contemporaneity, well established
by the uniform tradition accompanying all the lines of descent, which in a measure
will help to correct some of the lines of descent. The discrepancies are these:
</p>
<p>1. From Wakea to Kakuhihewa, on the straight Nanaulu line, through Mulielealii and
Maelo (w), there are forty-five generations, Kakuhihewa included.
</p>
<p>2. From Wakea to Kakuhihewa, on the Ulu-Puna-imua line, through Laulialaa—Maelo’s
husband—there are fifty generations, the difference lying between Ulu and Laulialaa.
</p>
<p>3. From Wakea to Kahoukapu, on the Ulu-Hema-Hanalaanui line, there are fifty-one generations;
but from Wakea to Laakapu (w) (the wife of Kahoukapu and sister of Laulialaa) there
are only forty generations on the Ulu-Puna-imua line. The difference lying probably
between Hema and Pili-Kaaiea, whom all the traditions correspond in asserting as having
come from Tahiti with Paao the Kahuna about the time of the great migration which
characterized the age of Moikeha, Olopana, etc., children of Mulielealii and their
contemporaries.
</p>
<p>4. The traditions all agree that Kanipahu of Hawaii married Hualani (w) of Molokai.
But Kanipahu stands forty-sixth on the Ulu-Hema and Hanalaanui line, whereas Hualani
stands thirty-fourth on the Nanaulu straight line through Keaunui-a-Maweke and his
daughter Nuakea. Kaakaualani (w) the wife of Kakuhihewa, stands forty-sixth on the
Nanaulu straight line, through Kalehenui-a-Maweke; but her mother, Kauhiiliula-a-Piilani,
stands fifty-eighth on the Ulu-Hema and Hanalaa-iki line; thus showing that notwithstanding
the era of commotion, displacement and migration, above referred to, the Nanaulu straight
line, through Maweke, his children and grandchildren, not only maintain a wonderful
correspondence and regularity between themselves, but each and all of them unite in
pointing out the discrepancies and probable interpolation on the Hema-Hanalaa lines
of descent. The first mentioned contemporaneity is those of <span class="corr" id="xd32e12056" title="Source: Ananini">Auanini</span> on the Ulu-Puna-imua line, and of Mua and her husband Kaomealani on the Maweke-Kalehenui
line from Nanaulu. Auanini stands thirty-first on his line from <span class="pageNum" id="pb245">[<a href="#pb245">245</a>]</span>Wakea, and Mua stands thirty-second on the other line. Tradition is circumstantial
that in their time the first foreigners (haole) came to this group—to Oahu, off Mokapu.
</p>
<p>5. The second recognized contemporaneity, that I have been able to find in the meles
and kaaos in my possession—saving and excepting always what may hereafter come to
light—is that of Kanipahu and his wife Hualani. According to the genealogy published
by D. Malo, Kanipahu was the forty-ninth from Wakea, and according to the Nanaulu-Keaunui-a-Maweke
line Hualani was the thirty-fourth from Wakea.
</p>
<p>6. The next recognized contemporaneity is that of Kalaunuiohua, according to D. Malo
the fifty-second from Wakea on the Hema-Hanalaanui line, and Kukona of Kauai with
whom he made war, and who is the forty-third on the Ulu-Puna-imua line.
</p>
<p>7. The next is that of Luakoa of Maui, forty-eighth or forty-ninth on the Hema-Hanalaa-iki
line, who made war on Mailikukahi who stands thirty-ninth on the Nanaulu straight
line through Mulielealii and Moikeha.
</p>
<p>8. The next is that of Kahoukapu of Hawaii, standing fifty-fourth on the Hema-Hanalaa-nui
line, who married Laakapu, daughter of Laamaikahiki, and who consequently stands fortieth
on the Ulu-Puna-imua line.
</p>
<p>9. The next is what may be considered as the historical, though medieval, period of
Hawaiian national life, viz: that of Piilani of Maui, Umi of Hawaii, and Kalaimanuia
of Oahu. The second stands fifty-eighth from Wakea, according to D. Malo; the first
is fifty-seventh on the Hema-Hanalaa-iki line, and the third is forty-third on the
Nanaulu straight line.
</p>
<p>From this time the different lines run with great regularity and correspondence, and
were proper authorities available, I think every apparent discrepancy could be satisfactorily
explained.
</p>
<p>I regret that I have only two genealogies of the Kauai chiefs: one furnished me by
the Hon. D. Kalakaua, the other published by S.&nbsp;M. Kamakau. The first gives only forty-four
generations from Wakea to Kualii of Oahu and Kauai; the second gives sixty generations
during the same period. The first counts through Mulielealii, Kumuhonua and Elepuukahonua;
the latter through Ulu and Puna-imua, and Ahukini-a-laa. The first falls five generations
short of the Nanaulu line through Moikeha to Kualii. The latter over-runs six generations,
counting from Laulialaa and Ahukini-a-laa who were brothers, besides the discrepancy
of five generations already noticed between the Nanaulu and Puna-imua lines, previous
to Laulialaa.
</p>
<p>But, if we cannot reconcile the line of Hema-Hanalaa-nui with that of Nanaulu in descending
the two streams from Wakea, let us ascend the streams of two such well-known contemporaries
as Kualii of Oahu (Nanaulu) and Keawe of Hawaii (Hema-Hanalaa-nui). If we thus ascend
sixteen generations on each line, we shall meet again with Hualani (w) on the Nanaulu-Keaunui-a-Maweke
line, and with her husband Kanipahu on the so-called Hema-Hanalaa-nui. Thus showing
that from Kanipahu, perhaps even from Kaniuhi, there has been no break or discrepancy
in the latter line. Sixteen or seventeen generations upward from Kualii, however,
bring us to the grandchildren of that boisterous period in Hawaiian history when Moikeha,
Kumuhonua and Olopana, the children of Mulielealii-a-Maweke, filled Hawaiian tradition
with their exploits and adventures abroad <span class="pageNum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>and at home; when voyages to and from Tahiti were of common occurrence; and when many
changes and additions to the customs and worship of the people were introduced.
</p>
<p>That Pili-Kaaiea was not the son of Laau-a-Lanakawai, that he was not even a Hawaiian
at all, but a Tahitian chief of high birth and great wealth, all the traditions and
the meles referring to the subject unmistakeably prove. That he established himself
on Hawaii, obtained a quasi supremacy there, founded a dynasty and a family by intermarriage
with Hawaiian chief-families, descendants of Nanaulu or of Ulu, is equally clear.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12075src" href="#xd32e12075">6</a>
</p>
<p>Are we then to conclude that the so-called <i>Hanalaanui</i> line of Hawaiian chiefs does not go any further back on Hawaii than the time of Pili?
I think not. The traditions tell us fully and circumstantially that both Olopana and
Kumuhonua, the sons of Mulielealii were established and living on Hawaii, that Moikeha’s
son Kila, their nephew, settled there. They tell us that Hikapoloa (k) and his wife
Mailelaulii were noted chiefs in Kohala before this time; that their granddaughter
Luukia was the wife of Olopana, and that their grandson Kaumailiula married Olopana’s
daughter, Kaupea. Although, therefore, it is impossible at this time to say with which
of the Ulu or Nanaulu branches Kanipahu or Kaniuhi were related; yet that they were
so related and that directly, is a certainty beyond doubt, to those who are acquainted
with the tabu systems and the social institutions and customs which, however modified
at different times, never abated an iota of their rigour as affecting the laws of
descent.
</p>
<p>From the fact that Ouanini, the grandson of Puna-imua, was contemporary with Mua,
on the Nanaulu-Kalehenui line,—their standing respectively thirty-first and thirty-second
from Wakea on their different lines—inclines me strongly to look for the difference
or discrepancy between these two lines among the names that follow Paumakua until
Ahukai, the father of Laamaikahiki.
</p>
<p>Although there certainly are not a few persons on these, the principal, lines of descent
from Wakea, to whom tradition has affixed a local habitation and a name; yet I think
it in vain to look for genealogical precision or historical data before the period
of Maweke and his affiliations on the Nanaulu line, or his probable contemporary Paumakua
and his near predecessors on the Ulu line.
</p>
<p>That the social and religious condition of the Hawaiian people underwent at about
that time several great and important changes,—caused no doubt by the influx of foreign
material and the intercourse with foreign lands<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12089src" href="#xd32e12089">7</a>—may safely be concluded from express statements and more or less plain allusions
in the traditions now extant. Thus the custom of circumcising is plainly traceable
up to the time of Paumakua, while it is nowhere spoken of or alluded to as forming
a religious necessity or a social custom among chiefs or common people before that
time, unless in the Moolelo of Kumuhonua.
</p>
<p>I have seen no mention of human sacrifices, before this period, either of captives
in war or on other solemn occasions. To this period is to be referred the powerful
priestly <span class="pageNum" id="pb247">[<a href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>family of Paao, who came with Pili from Tahiti; and Kaekae, Maliu and Malela, who
were brought by Paumakua from abroad and are said to have been white people and kahunas.
The “<span lang="haw">Aha Kapu o na ’lii</span>” is not of older date than the time of Paumakua—the “<span lang="haw">Kapu moe o na ’lii</span>” is of much later origin.
</p>
<p>Taking then thirty years as the measure of a generation, and the Nanaulu straight
line, as the least inflated and most reliable, we have twenty-six generations from
the time of Maweke to the present time, which places Maweke at the commencement of
the twelfth century, say A.D. 1100. And during that century those great migrations
to and fro with their resultant influx of new men and new ideas occurred. It was an
era of intense restlessness and great activity and daring. Up to this time Hawaiian
history is merely a register of names with only here and there a passing allusion
to some event, barely sufficient to give a <i lang="la">locus standi</i> to some prominent name, such as the building and inauguration of Kukaniloko as a
royal birth-place by Nanakaoko and his wife Kahihiokalani. This however must have
happened close upon the twelfth century, for their son and grandson—Kapawa and Heleipawa—were
no doubt contemporaries with Maweke or with Pili-Kaaiea. After the time of Maweke
of the Nanaulu line, and after Paumakua of the Ulu line, however, Hawaiian history
commences to flow with a fuller tide, and most of the principal names on either line
have some account or mele connected with them; the traditions and songs become more
numerous and circumstantial in their details, and, by crossing or confirming each
other, enable the critical student to arrive at a considerable degree of precision
in eliminating facts from myths and placing names and events in a proper succession
and in an approximately correct time.
</p>
<p>What the gradually growing or abruptly determining causes of this national restlessness
of these series of migrations may have been, either here or in central and western
Polynesia—perhaps also to and from the North American coasts—Hawaiian traditions and
meles throw no light upon, so far as I have been able to ascertain; and with the history
and traditions of those other countries I am not sufficiently acquainted to offer
an adequate or precise answer. The only corresponding movement in Central and Southern
Polynesia that I can now refer to is—I believe, but have not the authority by me—the
settlement of New Zealand by its present Polynesian race. Their traditions and genealogies
bring that event the fifteenth century of our era, and they came from Savaii, one
of the Navigator’s Islands. Our own traditions refer the advent here of Paao and Pili
from Wawau and Upolo, to an earlier period. Both were probably cases of expulsion
caused by civil wars.
</p>
<p>It is a somewhat remarkable circumstance that the first appearance of white men in
this Archipelago refers to this same period of migrations. The traditions state that
in the time of Auanini, the grandson of Puuaimua, and a chief living at Kapalawai
in Kailua, Oahu, and while Mua-o-Kalani and her husband Kaomealani were chiefs at
Kaopulolia in Kaneohe, Oahu, a vessel arrived off Mokapu; that the name of the vessel
was “Ulupana;” the name of the captain was Molo-Lana, and of his wife, Malaea; that
the names of the people on board were Olomana, Aniani and Holokaniakani; that these
however were not their proper names, but names given them by those chiefs on whose
territories they landed; the tradition however does not say whether these people went
away again or whether they remained and settled in the country.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb248">[<a href="#pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p>The next account of white people arriving here is found in the tradition and mele
of Paumakua, grandson of Auanini aforesaid, and an Oahu chief, who is said to have
visited numerous foreign lands (“Kaapuni ia Kahiki”), and who brought back with him
two white men, Auakahinu and Auakaaiea, who afterwards were called Kaekae and Maliu
and were said to have been kahunas (priests). Paumakua also brought back with him
another stranger called Malela who was a kaula (prophet), but as to whether this latter
was also a white man the tradition is not so explicit. The two former however are
described in the tradition as “Ka haole nui, maka alohilohi, ke aholehole maka aa,
ka puaa keokeo nui maka ulaula.” These, it would appear, remained and settled in the
country, as in later times we find several priestly families claiming and proving
their descent from the two former.
</p>
<p>I have taken the above notices of the first arrivals of white foreigners in this country
from S.&nbsp;M. Kamakau’s summary of the traditions and meles referring to that subject.
To what branches of the Caucasian race, if to that race at all, these “white people—with
bright eyes and white cheeks,” belonged, who in the twelfth century were found on
the borders or among the islands of the Pacific, may be a rare question for archaeologists
and ethnologists to settle. That they were looked upon by the natives here as people
of another and a lighter colored race than their own is evident. Whether they were
Japanese or some other Mongol variety, extended along the western shores of the Pacific,
or Toltecs, from the eastern rim of the Pacific and the Mexican coast, conquered and
expelled by the Aztecs towards the close of the twelfth century,—the fact however
stands forth in archaic simplicity, and becomes of historical importance, that, during
this period—genealogically computed to have fallen within the twelfth century—the
Hawaiians received large infusions not only of Polynesian blood, from the island to
the south and southwest, but also of alien races, from one or both continents bordering
on the Pacific, and leaving their traces in the physique as well as in the customs
and worship of the people.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12117src" href="#xd32e12117">8</a>
</p>
<p>This period of great migrations, of national activity and restlessness and of grand
enterprises, having passed, comparative quiet seems to have succeeded for several
generations; and the meles and legends become silent upon the subject of foreign voyages
or foreign arrivals until the time of Kakaalaneo, King of Maui and brother to the
great-grandfather of Piilani—about fourteen generations from the present—at the close
of the fifteenth or the commencement of the sixteenth century. The traditions as written
down by S.&nbsp;M. Kamakau runs thus: “In the time of Kakaalaneo several foreigners (haole)
arrived at Waihee in Maui, two of whom only were or became remarkable, viz.: Kukanaloa and Pele, who was Peleie, and the name of the vessel was Konaliloha. They
landed at Kiwe in the night and when discovered in the morning by the natives, they
were taken to the village and fed and brought to the king and the chiefs who treated
them kindly and made friends of them (<i lang="haw">hoopunahele</i>) and admitted them to all the privileges of the kapu. They settled in the country,
married some of the chief-women and became progenitors of both chiefs and commoners,
and some of their descendants <span class="pageNum" id="pb249">[<a href="#pb249">249</a>]</span>survive to this day.” “They were called Kanikawi and Kanikawa after the beautiful
flowers of Haumea.”—“Their speech sounded like a bird’s, like the <i lang="haw">lale</i> of the mountain, a chattering, vociferous bird.”—“They said they came from Kahiki,
from the very interior.” “Their land was a fertile land with plenty of fruits and
large animals.”—“Their parents dwelt far inland (<i lang="haw">uka</i>) on the side of the mountain, away up in the forest (<i lang="haw">ukaliloloa, i ka waonahele</i>).”—“They were acquainted with the banana, the breadfruit, the ohia-apples, and the
kukui nuts.”
</p>
<p>The tradition which refers to the wrecking and landing of the foreigners (haole)—two
men and one woman, at Keei, South Kona, Hawaii, in the time of Keliiokaloa, the son
of Umi-a-Liloa, before the middle of the sixteenth century,—is well known and has
long been recorded. There is some obscurity however thrown over both this and the
foregoing tradition, inasmuch as the names of the vessel (“Konaliloha”) and of the
principal personage (Kukanaloa) are the same in both traditions, and also some of
the attending circumstances. But whether it was only one and the same event, adopted—<i lang="la">mutalis mutandis</i>—on both islands, or two separate occurrences, the fact of the arrival, and the retention
of that fact in the Hawaiian memory, are none the less established.
</p>
<p>How these voyages were accomplished will not now excite any surprise when we know,
not only from the traditions, but from the ocular testimony of the grandparents of
the present generation, that the canoes of those times were of an enormous size compared
with the canoes of the present day. Double canoes carrying eighty men were not uncommon;
and it is reported by eye-witnesses that, as late as the year 1740, the favorite war
canoe, or admiral’s ship, “<i>Kaneaaiai</i>,” of Peleioholani of Oahu carried on board from one hundred and twenty to one hundred
and forty men, besides their provisions, water, etc. And it is further reported that
this canoe, and possibly others of similar dimensions, was made of pieces of wood
or planks fastened together, somewhat after the manner of Malay <i>proas</i> or Western Polynesian canoes at the present day. Though the Hawaiians had not the
compass or any substitute for it, yet they were fully and correctly acquainted with
the bearing and rising and setting of a large number of stars, by which they steered
during the night. It is reported as of no uncommon occurrence, for instance, that
the Kauai sea-rovers would make their descent on the Hawaii or Maui shores, plunder
or slay or capture whatever or whomsoever they could lay their hands on and then,
in order to elude pursuit, stand off, straight out of sight of land on the open ocean,
for two or three days, and return to their own homes by some circuitous route, either
to the windward or the leeward of the islands. There is now, or was not long ago,
the wreck of a large canoe lying on the shore near the southern point of Hawaii, which
measured one hundred and eight feet in length, and was said to have been one of a
double-canoe belonging to Kamehameha I.
</p>
<p>The Hawaiians being thus possessed of vessels capable of performing long voyages in
open sea, possessed of sufficient astronomical and practical knowledge to navigate
them, and of daring and enterprise to match with the boldest, it is but natural that
their traditions, sagas and songs, should be replete with their adventures and exploits
in foreign lands. In that they are overloaded with marvels, fables and exaggerations,
they only resemble the early and medieval periods of other countries. But <span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>when all these are stripped, there still remains an undisputable residium of facts
to show that from the eleventh and during the twelfth century, and subsequently, not
only were these islands visited by people of kindred and alien races whether arriving
here by accident or design, but also that the Hawaiians, themselves, performed frequent
though desultory voyages to the countries and islands lying south and west from their
own group; that from this period dates the establishment, or at least the prominence
of the principal dynasties and chief-families in the islands; and that from this time
the genealogical succession <i>on Hawaiian soil</i> may be pretty accurately ascertained.
</p>
<p>I know that Papa and Wakea, the reputed progenitors of the Hawaiian race of chiefs,
were also considered as gods, demi-gods, heroes and progenitors in nearly every other
Polynesian group of islands. I have seen it assumed that the twelfth or thirteenth
first names of the Haloa line were common to the Marquesan pedigrees and considered
as their ancestors. I know that Maui-a-kalana, who is said to have collected the sun’s
rays, to have discovered the fire, and to have nearly succeeded in joining these islands
together into one large continent, and whose name stands twenty-second on the Ulu
line,—I know that he is the hero of the same legends in the Samoan, Society, Marquesan
and New Zealand islands. While therefore I have no means of disputing the correctness
of the succession of names borne on Hawaiian pedigrees from Wakea to nearly the period
of Maweke, I am yet strongly of the opinion that those names, their legends and meles,
were introduced into this group about the time of Maweke and his contemporaries and
compeers, and during some of the next following generations. I am inclined to that
opinion from the fact that, while almost every Hawaiian chief-family that at some
time or other obtained prominence or influence in the country traced their pedigree
up to Maweke, his contemporaries or successors, and claim their descent from Wakea
through some one or other of the numerous branches springing from Maweke, Kapawa,
Paumakua or later offshoots from these, not one family, that I am aware of, pretends
to connect with either the Nanaulu or the Ulu lines beyond this period; thus proving
to me that these heroes were the first and actual progenitors of the Hawaiian families
of chiefs on Hawaiian soil, and that they brought with them from Kahiki their own
pedigrees up to their own time.
</p>
<p>Whoever knew this people some forty or fifty years ago, and more so if further back,
could not fail to observe the remarkable difference of appearance between the chiefs
and the makaainana (commoners) and the Kauwa-makauuli (slaves) indicating the former
as, if not of a different race, at least of a different and superior class to the
common multitude. And the feeling, solicitude and pride, with which that difference
was kept up, show that they looked upon themselves not only as a different class politically,
but also as of different birth socially. It was an heirloom from their ancestors and
came with them from Tahiti. No poverty, misery or misconduct could efface it. Though
there are many instances where chiefs were slain by their subjects in revolt, or were
deposed from supremacy by their peers or subordinate chiefs, yet there never was a
Bill of Attainder in those days, nor is there an instance of a chief who ever forfeited
his own rank as a chief (of the “Papa Alii”) or that of his children. Those chiefs,
those ancestors of the Hawaiian aristocracy, did not however, as I have endeavored
to show, appear on Hawaiian soil much earlier than the period of those great migrations,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb251">[<a href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>that national or intertribal displacement of the Polynesian race which occurred during
the eleventh and twelfth centuries of our era. It may have commenced a generation
or two before Maweke,—it certainly continued several generations after him—but I use
his name as a kind of central figure, seeing that the line upon which he stands (the
Nanaulu straight line) is probably the most correct of existing genealogies.
</p>
<p>What preceded this time will ever be a blank in Hawaiian history. There are traditions,
no doubt, which refer to a period previous to this, but they all seem to bear the
impress of Tahitian origin: There are no legends more common or more generally known
throughout these islands than those of Kamapuaa and of Pele; and Koolauloa on Oahu,
and Hilo, Puna, and Kau on Hawaii, abound in places and names connected with these
stories. Yet Kamapuaa’s grandparents came from Kuaihelani (wherever that island may
have been), and he himself visited Kahiki and married there; and Pele also came from
Kahiki and, after traversing this group, finally settled on Hawaii. A better acquaintance
than I possess, with Samoan, Tahitian, Marquesan or New Zealand legends, would enable
the critical student to decide whether these and other legends of the pre-historic
times were original and exclusive to the Hawaiian group, or whether they had their
root, prototype or correspondent in those other groups and were only adapted to Hawaiian
locality in the course of time and the process of naturalization, thus illustrating
the Latin poet’s remark that “<span lang="la">qui trans mare currunt, coelum non animam mutant.</span>” It is noticeable, moreover, that all the heroes and heroines of these pre-historic
legends stand out in bold relief from the genealogical tree of Haloa, singly and disconnected,
and that none of the numerous chief-families of after-ages ever claimed their descent
from Wakea through these personages. Not having had the opportunity of more fully
comparing these legends with those of other Polynesian groups, I have compared them
with each other and with legends of a later date, which no doubt belong to the oft-referred-to
period of migrations, however much enveloped in myths and fable, and I have found,
as I think, internal evidence that if these prehistoric legends were of Hawaiian origin
at all, and not merely Tahitian legends adapted to Hawaiian localities,—then their
origin can not be older than this period of influx of the Tahitian element. Thus,
for instance, a number of chief-families, on the different islands of this group,
trace their pedigrees with great accuracy and evenness up to Maweke through his grand-daughter
Nuakea, daughter of Keaunui-a-Maweke and sister of Laakona of Ewa. These genealogies
concur in representing Keoloewa-a-Kamauaua of Molokai as the husband of Nuakea. They
also indicate Kaupeepee-nui-kauila as brother of Keoloewa and of the man who abducted
Hina, the wife of Hakalanileo. Hina’s sons, Kana and Niheu-kalohe, afterwards rescued
their mother and slew Kaupeepee, demolishing his fortress at Haupu on Molokai. Thus
Niheu-kalohe becomes contemporary with the grand-children of Maweke, and, moreover,
his grandmother Uli was a Tahitian woman. There are probably few legends of older
or of fuller details than this of Kana and Niheu-kalohe, yet it is ostensibly and
really, both as regards the persons and the time, of post-Maweke origin. If we now
turn to the equally well-known and equally circumstantial legend of Pele’s sister,
Hiiakaikapoliopele, we find that, when she was resting at the house of Malaehaakoa
in Haena, Kauai, previous to ascending the Pali of Kalalau in search of <span class="pageNum" id="pb252">[<a href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>Lohiau, Malaehaakoa offered up a prayer or chant,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12169src" href="#xd32e12169">9</a> than which few Hawaiian meles bear stronger evidences of a comparatively genuine
antiquity: and yet this mele, prayer or chant, makes special reference to Niheu-kalohe
and to Nuakea—an anachronism showing fairly that the mele as well as the legend originated
after the time of Maweke’s grandchildren.
</p>
<p>I would not be understood as asserting that there were neither chiefs nor people on
the island of this group before this period of migrations. The meles and legends are
full to the contrary. This very family of Kamauaua and its kindred on Molokai; those
of Pueonui and Kealiiloa on Kauai; those of Hikapoloa on Hawaii and Kaikipaananea
and Puna on Kauai, and others, whose names and whose pedigrees have never been transferred
or connected with the lives of Haloa, attest the presence, and previous occupation
of the islands by both chiefs and people. But these chiefs were gradually displaced,
and disappeared before the new element, the Tahitian influx, with its new gods, its
new tabus, and its greater vigour and moral and intellectual power. Whatever the causes
that brought these latter ones here, yet, to judge from the case of Pili and Paao,
they were not low-born adventurers, but men of mark in their own country, <i lang="haw">alii kapu</i>, with whom alliances were sought, to whom the vacant chief-seats and the <i lang="haw">ahuula</i> naturally fell in the lapse of time, and who kept bards to sing their own names and
those of their ancestors, and heralds to proclaim their unbroken descent from Wakea
and from Haloa.
</p>
<p>The strongest proof, however, as I think, of the absence of Hawaiian genealogies and
of the utter darkness which enveloped Hawaiian history proper before that period,
is to be found—as I have already stated—in the fact that all the prominent Hawaiian
chief-families connect with the line of Wakea through Ulu or Nanaulu about this time,
and that, in order to establish that connection, they counted through females as well
as through males, and dropped the latter whenever they did not lead up to the main
trunk of Wakea or someone of that Tahitian element which made its appearance about
the eleventh, twelfth, or thirteenth centuries of our era, and who are invariably
called “na kupuna alii”—founders of dynasties,—on this or that island.
</p>
<p>That the people of this group, whether chiefs or commoners, previous to this period,
were of Polynesian—or as they themselves call it—Tahitian origin, there is no good
ground for doubting, and every reason to believe. But the time of their arrival and
settlement, the mode of their arrival, their point of departure, and their political,
religious and social condition, will probably always remain insoluble problems. That
they arrived here long ages before these later Tahitians,—before their kapu-system,
heiau-building, religious ceremonial, etc., had developed into that complex, fanciful
and stern rule of life, which it had already become when we first are made acquainted
with them,—I think may generally be conceded. From the traditions and meles of these
Tahiti-Hawaiians I gather that they found the previous inhabitants of this group living
in a primitive manner, without any political organization beyond the patriarchal,
and without kapus—at least of any stringent nature—and without heiaus;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12183src" href="#xd32e12183">10</a> and, with a <span class="pageNum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253">253</a>]</span>feeling of pride in their superior powers and attainments, although they acknowledged
Hawaii as a “Kama <i>na Tahiti</i>” (a child of <i>Kahiki</i>), yet they looked upon it as a natural appanage of themselves, to be taken possession
of and reconstructed by them and their posterity. They established political supremacy
and the kapus, they built heiaus, introduced circumcision, the <i lang="haw">pahu</i>, the <i lang="haw">ohe</i> and the <i lang="haw">hula</i>. Tattooing commenced with them. The division of the people into aliis, kahunas, makaainanas
and Kauwa-makawela, if not original with them, received a distinctness and permanency
from them that hardened almost into castes. In short, whatever the condition in which
they found the country, they moulded, reorganized and arranged everything on their
own pattern and, while they with most elaborate care have left us numerous mementoes
of their own time and work, they have left us nearly none of the predecessors.
</p>
<p>While the Hawaiian cosmogonies abundantly betray their Tahitian origin, they also
develop some interesting facts which will throw some light on the subject of the Tahitians’
(I mean in the Hawaiian sense of the word) settling here at the period to which I
have referred. Thus, though the traditions and meles differ as to the actual origin
of these islands, some stating them to have been born of Papa and Wakea—a kind of
mythical setting back their creation to the oldest known period of time, and others
assuming them to be fished up from the sea by Kapuhauanui, a fisherman from Kapaahu
in Tahiti, and others again that they sprung forth from the night, yet several concur
in representing them as forming only a group in a chain of groups of islands extending
from Nuumealani on one side to Holani, Nuuhiwa and Polapola on the other; and the
Mele of Kamahualele, the kahuna of Moikeha, who accompanied him from Kahiki, distinctly
states that long before his time Nuuhiwa and Polapola were severed from this chain.
Thus the existence and bearings of these islands were known to the Tahitians before
their last settlement here; and they knew of the existence of other islands contiguous
to this group, or intermediate between this and the eastern and central Polynesian
groups, of which neither the names nor the location can now be traced. Another circumstance
connected with these lost islands is, that while the meles and traditions referring
to times and persons anterior to the last Tahitian settlement here are full of notices
of Nuumea-lani and Holani and Kuaihelani, as within easy reach of, and having had
frequent intercourse with this group, yet none of the meles and traditions that I
possess makes any mention of them as existing at the time of, or subsequent to, that
last Tahitian emigration. Thus the Mele of Kamahualele and the traditions of Moikeha,
Olopana, Kila, and Laamaikahiki, make no mention of them as having been visited by
these worthies or seen by them in their voyages to and from Tahiti. The traditions
of Hema, Paumakua and Kahai also ignore them as existing at that time. The tradition
of Paao does not refer to them in his voyage with Pili from Tahiti (Moaulanuiakea)
to Hawaii.
</p>
<p>In comparing the New Zealand legends as published by Sir George Grey, I find that
the New Zealanders count fifteen generations from the time of their ancestors leaving
the land of Hawaiki, in the Samoan or Navigator’s group and settling in New Zealand,
which was called by them “Aotearoa.” Fifteen generations or four hundred and fifty
years bring the approximate period of that settlement to about 1400 our era, or from
two hundred and fifty to three hundred years later than the last Tahitian settlement
in this group, the Hawaiian. In the legends, however, which they carried with <span class="pageNum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>them to New Zealand, occurs not only the well-known story of Maui-a-Kalana (Maui-o-Taranga)
and his exploits by sea and land, and of his grandmother, who pulled out her nails
to furnish him with fire and who is called Mahu-ika—in the Hawaiian genealogy she
is called Hina-Mahu-ia; but there also occurs four prominent and comparatively late
names in the Hawaiian Ulu and Hema line of descent, viz: Hema, Tawhaki (Kahai), Wahieroa
(Wahieloa) and Raka (Laka). In the New Zealand legends they figure as chiefs and arikis
of Hawaiki, following one another in the same succession as in the Hawaiian genealogy.
</p>
<p>Thus, on New Zealand testimony, Hema, Kahai, Wahieloa and Laka were chiefs of Hawaiki
or Sawaii in the Samoan group, and not of Hawaii in this group. These names and their
pedigrees must then have been carried from Hawaiki to Tahiti and from Tahiti to this
group, unless we assume a direct settlement from Hawaiki to Hawaii.
</p>
<p>It is true, certainly, that the Hawaiian legends ascribe a local habitation as well
as a name to each of these four chiefs, either on Maui, Oahu or Kauai, and places
and monuments connected with their names are existing to this day; yet, as there is
no reasonable probability that the New Zealanders took their departure from this group
instead of the Samoan, and as their evidence is positive as to the residence of these
chiefs in the Hawaiki which they knew and from which they departed for New Zealand,—I
am forced to conclude that the connecting of their names with places in this group
was merely adaptation in after ages, an appropriation to Hawaiian soil, when the memory
of the mother-country had become indistinct and when little if anything was known
of them except the one main fact that they stood on the genealogical list of the Hawaiian
chiefs, a fact, which was never allowed to be forgotten under the old system, however
much local associations may be forgotten or altered.
</p>
<p>It is hardly historically possible that there could have been two series of chiefs
in Hawaiki (Samoa) and Hawaii with identical names and in the same succession; and,
with one transposition only, the identity holds good also in the names of their wives—e.g.:

</div><p>
</p>
<p>I am justified therefore in concluding that the Ulu-Hema line of chiefs was not indigenous
to the Hawaiian Islands until after the time of Laka. But Laka was the third from
Hema who, by all the Hawaiian traditions, was the brother of Puna-imua, and consequently
the contemporary of Paumakua on the Ulu-Puna line, and probably of Maweke or his father
on the Nanaulu straight line.
</p>
<p>Whether the scions of these three lines, descending from Wakea and Papa, arrived here
about the same time, or whether the Puna and Maweke lines arrived at a long interval
from each other, or who had the precedence in the country, it is now impossible to
determine.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12258src" href="#xd32e12258">11</a> That they came from the Samoan group, through the Tahitian <span class="pageNum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>and Marquesas groups, after a longer or shorter stoppage in each or both, I think
can be shown from philological grounds and the gradual transformation of the Hawaiian
dialect, conforming more to those of the two latter than to that of the former.
</p>
<p>I am thus led back to the proposition which I have already enunciated, that, whichever
was the branch of the great Polynesian family, that in ages long past first settled
upon these islands and here remained and increased, yet about twenty-eight generations
ago, and for several generations succeeding, there arrived here an influx of new-comers
from the same Polynesian family, who through their superior intellectual and physical
prowess obtained the supremacy,—politically, morally and socially,—brought with them
their genealogies, their religion, and their customs; and with whom, and from whom
only, Hawaiian history can be traced downward through its heroic, medieval and modern
pagan development. It will be observed by the different pedigrees that all the chief-families,
which connect with the Nanaulu line, do so immediately through someone of the children
or grandchildren of Maweke, who is either the twenty-fourth, twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth
ancestor of these families, as the case may be. Whereas, on the other hand, no family
that connects with the Ulu-Puna line, does so above Laamaikahiki’s children who stand
seventh from Paumakua, thus making him the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth ancestor;
and several families, connecting with both lines, make both Maweke and Paumakua either
twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth in the line. With the Ulu-Hema-Hanalaa-nui line, however,
no family that I am aware of connects as one of the children of Kanipahu, who stands
sixth from Pili-Kaaiea, which makes the latter the twenty-fourth ancestor. Kanipahu’s
son Kalahumoku is sixth from Maweke through his mother Hualani. Kanipahu’s son Kalapana
is also sixth (?) from Pili, and I consequently infer that Pili and Maweke were contemporaries.
</p>
<p>Pili’s arrival from Tahiti—some traditions specify the island of Wawau—is one of the
most noted events of this period. Of the arrivals of Maweke and Paumakua, or their
immediate ancestors, the traditions are silent, but their immediate descendants were
famous for their voyages to and from Tahiti. The traditions are conflicting in regard
to Maweke’s grandchildren, from Mulielealii, some representing them as born in this
country and properly belonging here, while others represent them as settlers arriving
from Tahiti. However that may be, they named numerous places, mountains, rivers and
headlands either after persons accompanying them, or after similar places in the land
from which they came. Yet strange to say, although the island of Hawaii was evidently
so called after the Samoan “Hawaiki” or Tongan “Hapai” and that island was known to
the Tongans, New Zealanders, Tahitians and Marquesans, yet none of the Hawaiian legends,
meles or genealogies, that I have seen, refer to it by that name, though Upolo, Wawau,
and probably other islands of that and neighboring groups, are referred to by their
special names.
</p>
<p>On the Ulu line, previous to Puna-i-mua and Hema, occur the names of Kapawa and of
his parents Nanakaoko and Kahihiokalani, which stand too conspicuously connected with
the traditions of purely Hawaiian origin and with that famous birth-place of Hawaiian
chiefs, Kukaniloko, to doubt that they belonged and lived on Hawaii-nei, or to include
them among those prehistoric names which figure on the genealogies previous to the
Tahitian settlements, <i>tempore</i> Maweke, Paumakua and Pili. In a fragment <span class="pageNum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>of the legend (or rather synopsis) of Paao, which I have, while speaking of the arrival
of Pili, it is expressly stated that, when Pili came to these islands, Hawaii was
without chiefs on account of the crimes of Kapawa (“Ua pau na Alii mua o Hawaii-nei
i ka hewa o Kapawa, ke alii o Hawaii nei ia manawa”); thus evidently making Kapawa
contemporary with the period of the Tahitian migrations.
</p>
<p>The New Zealand legends have shown that the four chiefs Hema, Kahai, Wahieloa and
Laka were Samoan chiefs and not Hawaiian, and as Kapawa is represented on the Hawaiian
genealogy of Ulu as being the great-grandfather of Hema and his brother Puna-imua;
and further as he is only third in descent from that mythical demi-god Maui-a-Kalana
and only second in ascent from the almost equally mythical Hinahanaiakamalama, the
wife of Aikanaka and mother of Hema, who went up to the moon and whose leg was pulled
off by her husband while ascending, I therefore think myself justified in concluding
that Kapawa and probably his parents are misplaced on the genealogy of Ulu, and that
they belong to a much later period—the period of Tahitian migrations.
</p>
<p>I have hitherto not referred to the Hanalaa-nui or Hanalaa-iki lines in their earlier
portions. It is well-known that before the consolidation of the islands under one
government, by Kamehameha I, the Maui bards and genealogists claimed Hanalaa-nui as
the ancestor of their race of chiefs, while the Hawaiians proper also set up the same
claim. But it would seem that even the Hawaiian bards and genealogists were not agreed
on this subject; for I possess an ancient mele, evidently composed in the interest
of Kamehameha I and his dynasty, which traces his descent from Paumakua and Hanalaa-nui—not
Hanalaa-iki—through Maui-loa and not through Lanakawai, and then through Alo, Waohaakuna,
etc., to Kikamanio Laulihewa and Maili-kukahi, and thence down the Oahu-Maweke line
to Kalanikauleleiaiwi etc. But this mele makes Laulihewa the seventh from Paumakua
in the descent, or the sixteenth from Kamehameha I in the ascent. Now on the uncontested
Nanaulu-Maweke line Laulihewa is the seventeenth from Kamehameha, and on the equally
uncontested Paumakua-Lauli-a-laa line Laulihewa is also the seventeenth from Kiwalao,
Kamehameha’s cousin, this latter line having the double advantage of having been crossed
both by the Maui and Oahu lines. Assuming, therefore, that Laulihewa’s position is
correct in this mele, or nearly so, Hanalaa-nui’s place on the pedigree will be fifth
or sixth from Laulihewa, or a contemporary with Moikeha on the Nanaulu straight line,
or with Nana or Kumakaha on the Ulu-Paumakua line. In either case Hanalaa, whether
“nui” or “iki,” falls within the period of the Tahitian migrations, and their lines
must suffer a proportionate curtailment of the names which now figure on them. That
Haho, who in this mele stands next after Paumakua, and second above Hanalaanui, belonged
to the new era, inaugurated by the arrivals from Tahiti, I conclude from the fact
that with him commences the record of the Aha-alii, a peculiar institution not known
before this time, and an indispensable accompaniment of an Alii-kapu (a sacred chief).
</p>
<p>Without such excision of names I can see no way of reconciling the Nanaulu straight
line and its numerous branches, or the Puna-imua-Paumakua-Laamaikahiki line and its
equally numerous branches, with the Hema-Hanalaa lines, so as to bring known contemporaries
on a nearly parallel step of descent from those whom they all claim <span class="pageNum" id="pb257">[<a href="#pb257">257</a>]</span>as common ancestors. For instance, on her father’s side, H.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;H. Kinau (the present
King’s mother) was sixty-eighth from Wakea, counting by the commonly received Hanalaa-nui
line; and on her mother’s side she was seventy from Wakea, counting by the Hanalaa-iki
line. But by the Nanaulu straight line, connecting at Kalanikauleleaiwi I, Kinau was
only fifty-third from Wakea, and even by the Ulu-Puna line and several of its branches
she was only fifty-seventh from Wakea. The difference of fifteen and seventeen generations
between the Hanalaa lines and the Nanaulu straight line, and even the difference of
eleven and thirteen between the Hana and Puna lines, is too great to be accounted
for in a natural way, such as the earlier marriages in one line than in another. I
am therefore forced to conclude that this excess of names on the Hanalaa-Hema lines
was made up of contemporaries or collaterals and engrafted in aftertimes on the original
lines. From the present time up to Maweke, Paumakua, and Pili, who stand respectively
twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh from Kamehameha I and his contemporaries
the genealogical lines cross each other by intermarriages so often, and traditional
notices of contemporary chiefs are so frequent, that there is comparatively little
difficulty in verifying any given name or finding its proper place. Here then, properly
speaking, Hawaiian history commences, and I will now endeavor to show the most prominent
names on the different lines, their connection and their exploits.

<p class="first">In the Viti group the kings are called <i>tui</i> of the land over which they reign. In Tonga and some other of the Polynesian isles
the highest chief is called <i>tui</i>. The Tui-Tonga family descended from the gods.
</p>
<p>The Viti gods were in the following gradation: Lan-Hanalu (Polynesian, Kane?); Kalu,
god of the kapu, there called “tambu;” the inferior gods were Kalu Niuza, Reizo, Vazugui-Berata,
Vazugui-Ton-ha, Komei-Buni-Kura, Balu-Bunti, Leka, Uleguen-Buna, Banu-Be, Tambo-Kana-Lauhi,
Buta-Guibalu, Dauzina, Komainen-Tulugubuca; the principal goddesses were Gulia-Zavazo,
and Goli-Koro.
</p>
<p>These gods inhabited a heaven called Numa-Lauhi. (What relation does that bear to
the <i>Nuumealani</i> of the Hawaiians?)
</p>
<p>Oudin-Hei, or Oudin-Hi, is the creator of heaven, earth and all the other gods. After
death, every soul goes to join Oudin-Hei.
</p>
<p>The Viti priests are called <i>ambetti</i>.
</p>
<p>The Vitians make no human sacrifices; they worship no images. They have sacred houses
called <i>ambure</i>. (Compare Hawaiian, “pule”). At the death of a king or queen they cut off a finger
or a toe, but not in times of sickness, like the Tongans. The Vitians use no betel,
but drink awa like the other Polynesians.
</p>
<p>At the age of fifteen years, the Vitians practice circumcision by slitting the prepuce.
</p>
<p>Though they marry at an early age, they do not cohabit with their wives until they
are twenty years old, for fear they should die—a religious injunction of the kapu.
Wives are not sold by their husbands.
</p>
<p>The women do not eat with the men, but afterwards.
</p>
<p>The awa plant is called <i>augona</i>.
</p>
<p>Coconut trees are climbed by means of a cord between the feet.
</p>
<p>Tabuing in Viti is practised as in Hawaii and elsewhere in Polynesia. The tabu-tree
is called <i>alauzi</i>.
</p>
<p>The Vitians know how to make earthen vessels (pottery), probably derived from the
Papuans of New Guinea.
</p>
<p>Anthropophagy is common in the Viti group; enemies and others are equally acceptable.
</p>
<p>The Viti canoes are fitted with out-riggers.
</p>
<p>The hair is tied up with white thin kapa, resembling a turban, like the Papuans of
Vegiu.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb259">[<a href="#pb259">259</a>]</span></p>
<p>When a chief dies, a number of his wives are killed to keep him company.
</p>
<p>The Vitians do not change their names in sign of friendship, like the Polynesians.
</p>
<p>On the Isle of Laguemba, the Tongans have settled and intermarried with the Vitians.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The name for north and northeast wind is <i>tokalau</i>. In Hawaiian, <i>koolau</i> is the north and northeast side of an island. In Tahiti, <i>toerau</i> is the west and southwest.
</p>
<p>Rev. Thos. Williams considers the Fiji group as the place of contact between the two
races which occupy east and west Polynesia, or, “The Asiatic and African, but not
Negro,” as he designated them. “The light Mulatto skin and well-developed muscles
seen to windward are chiefly the result of long intercourse with the Tongan race.”
“The Fijians have never acknowledged any power (foreign), but such as exists among
themselves.”
</p>
<p>“Rank is hereditary, descending through the female.”
</p>
<p>“As in the Malayan, so in the Fijian, there exists an aristocratic dialect, which
is particularly observable in the windward districts.”
</p>
<p>“Standing in the presence of a chief is not allowed. All who move about the house
in which he is, creep, or, if on their feet, advance bent as in an act of obeisance.”
</p>
<p>In drinking toasts and wishing, the expression often is for a “<i>puaka loloa</i>,”—a long pig,—meaning a human body, to be eaten.
</p>
<p>The Fijians reverence certain stones as shrines of the gods. Offerings of food are
sometimes made at these. (They resemble the <i>pohaku a Kane</i> in Hawaii).
</p>
<p>In Fiji, “sika” means “to appear” and is used chiefly of supernatural beings. (Does
the Hawaiian <i>hika</i> in the name of Kane, “Hika-poloa,” connect or find its explanation in the former?)
</p>
<p>Fijian traditions mention mankind springing from two eggs laid by a small hawk and
hatched by Ndengei, their principal god. They refer to a flood from which eight people
were saved in a canoe. They also mention a big tower built for the purpose of ascertaining
if the moon was inhabited, but the foundations gave way and the workmen were scattered
all over Fiji. They refer to a woman of Yaro, named Kerukeru, who was very good and
whom the gods removed from this world alive on consideration of her high character.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The New Zealanders derive themselves from Hawaiki, either the Samoan, Sawaii, or the
Tongan, Habai.
</p>
<p>One tradition has it that they descend from two brothers: Maui-mua and Maui-potiki;
that the elder, Maui-mua, killed his younger brother and ate him, whence the custom
of cannibalism among them.
</p>
<p>Another tradition says that Maui was driven from his native land, and, embarking <span class="pageNum" id="pb260">[<a href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>with his company, and guided by the god of thunder, Tauraki, arrived at, and settled
on the banks of the river Churaki.
</p>
<p>At the North Cape and at Bay of Islands the tradition refers to a large country situated
to the north and northwest of New Zealand, called <i>Ulimaraa</i> or <i>Oudi-mara</i> (English, Ortagi), a land exposed to the heat of the sun and abounding in hogs. Some
of the New Zealand ancestors went there at one time in a large canoe, and only a few
returned, having been absent about one month. Another tradition mentions that a small
vessel came from that country; four of the crew landed at Tatara-nui and were killed
by the New Zealanders.
</p>
<p>New Zealand is called by the natives “Aotea-roa.” The North Island is called “Ika-na-Maui,”
and the South Island, “Kauai-Punamu.”
</p>
<p>The Ngatipaoa tribe count fifteen generations since their ancestors left Hawaiki and
came to New Zealand.
</p>
<p>One of the canoes, in which they came, was called <i>Arawa</i>. It was made from a “Torara tree that was cut down in Rarotonga, which lies on the
other side of Hawaiki.” When another of these emigrant canoes, called the <i>Kainui</i> was ready, Rata, one of the builders, slew the son of Manaia and hid his body in
the chips and shavings of the canoes. This resembles the Hawaiian legend of Paao and
his brother when the former left for Hawaii.
</p>
<p>No hogs were in New Zealand in Cook’s time, or for some time afterwards.
</p>
<p>As in most of the Polynesian tribes, New Zealand women are admitted to the succession
in the government; so also with the Battas in Sumatra.
</p>
<p>Among the Battas, the descendants of the rajahs form a class in society, similar to
the rangatiras of New Zealand, Tahiti and other Polynesian tribes.
</p>
<p>The <i>kampong</i>, or fortified places of the Battas are nearly identical with the <i>pa</i> of the New Zealanders.
</p>
<p>The three gods of the Battas, Batara-Guru, Sora-Pada and Maugala-Bulong, correspond
in attributes to the New Zealand Maui-Rangi, Tauraki and Maui-Mua. The first is the
great god of all, the second has power over the air and all between heaven and earth,
and the last rules over the earth.
</p>
<p>Cannibalism is common to both nations; also polygamy.
</p>
<p>The victor chief in New Zealand eats the eye of his slain enemy. In Tahiti the eye
of the human sacrifice was offered by the priest to the officiating chief. In Hawaii
that custom probably obtained formerly. The expression <i>eia kuu maka</i>, used as a mark of submission or devotion to another, most likely refers to some
such ancient custom, but neither that nor cannibalism were practised in Hawaii, at
least no trace of them remains in their traditions.
</p>
<p>A New Zealand chief’s wife frequently hung herself on the death of her husband. There
was no law or absolute necessity for so doing, but it was a custom whose observance
was much applauded as the mark of a true and devoted wife.
</p>
<p>In New Zealand the awa root is not used as a beverage, as in the other Polynesian
tribes. The <i lang="la">piper excelsum</i>, called <i>kawa</i> grows there, but is not used. No salt nor spices is used with victuals.
</p>
<p>Pigs and poultry were introduced by Europeans. Dogs and rats were indigenous, <span class="pageNum" id="pb261">[<a href="#pb261">261</a>]</span>or came with the Polynesians. The New Zealanders called the condor by the Polynesian
name of poultry, <i>moa</i>. They then retained and transferred the name, though they did not succeed in bringing
hens with them when they emigrated to New Zealand.
</p>
<p>The legends about Maui, his adventures, his fishing up the earth from the water, his
getting fire, his fish-hook, Manaiakalani, are many and mostly coincide with the Hawaiian
legends. (See Grey’s “Polynesian Mythology.”) Those legends of Maui were recognized
and more or less known through all the Polynesian groups, and hence probably arrived
with the first settlers. One of the New Zealand traditions has it that the three Mauis
concurred in the creation of man and, subsequently, of woman from him. On Hawaii and
on the Society group a similar legend, <i lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i>, obtained.
</p>
<p>There is also a legend of Lono (Rona), who fell in a well, caught in a tree, and was
taken up to the moon, where he is still visible. This resembles somewhat the Hawaiian
legend of Lonomoku or Hinahanaiakamalama, the wife of Aikanaka and reputed mother
of Puna and Hema.
</p>
<p>The New Zealanders call foreigners by the name, <i>pakeha</i>. (Any analogy to the Hawaiian, pakea, a kind of white stone?)
</p>
<p>The constellation known as Orion’s belt was called by New Zealanders <i>waka</i>, the canoe.
</p>
<p>The variation in legends indicate that the north and south islands of New Zealand
received their inhabitants at different times.

<h3 class="main">TONGA ISLANDS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Tonga Islands had places of refuge, sacred enclosures, where fugitives were safe.
The same in Hawaii.
</p>
<p>The Tongans have a tradition that they were descendants from Bolotu, an island somewhere
in the northwest, in this wise: Some of the inferior gods of Bolotu, to the number
of about two hundred men and women left to visit the new land of Tonga after it had
been pulled out of the water by the god Tangaloa. Having arrived, they concluded to
stop and took their vessel to pieces. A few days afterwards some of them died, and
one, being inspired, told them that having eaten the fruits and breathed the air of
Tonga, they had lost their immortality, and that they were destined to people the
world, and that all that surrounded them would also be perishable—“<i>mea ma-ma</i>.” They built a canoe to return to Bolotu, but they never succeeded in finding that
land and returned sorrowfully to Tonga.
</p>
<p>Another tradition reports that Tangaloa was fishing one day in the great ocean, when
his leaden hook caught into something and on pulling at it a number of rocks came
in sight, getting larger and larger, when the line broke and the Tonga Isles remained
as they are. A place at Hounga is still shown where the hook caught in the rocks.
That hook was still in the possession of the family of the Tui-Tonga some thirty years
before Mariner’s time. The New Zealanders and Hawaiians have a similar tradition,
but make Maui the hero of the tale.
</p>
<p>Hogs were common in Tonga before its discovery. Dogs were scarce and mostly brought
from the Vitis. Poultry abounded.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb262">[<a href="#pb262">262</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Tongans believe that heaven, the planets, ocean and the isle Bolotu existed before
the earth; and the Tonga isles were fished up from the ocean by Tangaloa.
</p>
<p>Mankind came from Bolotu, the principal residence of the gods, placed in the northwest.
The souls of the <i>egui</i> or chiefs, after death, go to Bolotu. The souls of the <i>matabule</i> go there too, but to serve the former and the gods. The Tongans were not agreed as
to whether the <i>mua</i> had a soul or not; but the <i>tua</i> positively had none, or if they had, it died with the body. The <i>Tui-Tonga</i> and the <i>Veachi</i> descend in direct line from two of the principal gods.
</p>
<p>The Tongans reckon about three hundred primitive gods, of which about twenty only
are honored with temples and priests. Tali-ai-tubo is the god of war. Tui-fua-Bolotu
presided over the divine assembly at Bolotu, but is less in power than the preceding.
Hihuleo is a powerful god, worshiped by the Tui-Tonga family. Tubo-Toti, is the god
of voyages. Alai Valu is the god consulted in sickness. Alo-Alo is the god of wind,
rain, seasons and vegetation. Tangaloa, is the god of arts and inventions. Hala-Api-Api,
Togui Uku, Mea and Tubo-Bugo are gods of the sea and voyages.
</p>
<p>The universe reposes on the body of the god Maui. He is the giant among the gods,
but has no temple nor priests. When he is fatigued lying in one position, he turns,
and that is the cause of earthquakes.
</p>
<p>The tabu system was much developed in Tonga in its minutiæ and operations. It is essentially
the same through the entire Polynesian family; the variations in degree and intensity
are local.
</p>
<p>Tu-i-Tonga, the highest chief, descended from one of the gods that formerly visited
Tonga. The respect shown him arises solely from his religious character. He was a
kind of sovereign pontiff, and until modern times nothing of importance was done without
consulting him. Veachi, another chief or <i>egui</i> of divine descent; second in rank to the Tu-i. The priests have no social consideration
as such, unless they are inspired.
</p>
<p><i>Hu</i>, or the king, is the highest in power, but not in nobility. <i>Egui</i>, nobles, are allied and related to the families of Tu-i, Veachi or Hu. <i>Matabule</i>, the class just below the egui, are counsellors and officers. The title is hereditary,
and the son does not enter the class of <i>matabule</i> until the father’s death. Until then he belongs to the class called <i>mua</i>, composed of the sons, brothers and descendants of matabule. The sons and brothers
of a <i>mua</i> belong to the last class called <i>tua</i> until the death of the parent. The <i>tua</i> comprise all who do not come under one of the preceding categories of rank. They
are the common people.
</p>
<p>Hogs in Tonga are called <i>buaka</i>, as in Marquesas; in Hawaii, <i>puaa</i>.
</p>
<p>The Tongans were not cannibals, but sometimes in imitation of the Vitians, it became
a military point of honor for the young warriors to eat the flesh of an enemy slain
in battle.
</p>
<p>Among the Tongan dances were the <i>hea</i>, a very ancient and stately dance performed by men, and the <i>ula</i>, also very ancient, practised formerly only by the low classes, but a Tonga chief
having seen it performed at Samoa,—where it was said to have been invented,—made it
fashionable in Tonga.

<h3 class="main">MARQUESAS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From the Hiwaoa traditions and meles, collected by Mr. William Lawson, several cosmogonies
seem to have existed among the Marquesans. I notice:
</p>
<p>1. The <i>Vanana na Tanaoa</i> relates, that in the beginning there was no life, light or sound in the world; that
a boundless night, Po (darkness) enveloped everything, over which Tanaoa and Mutuhei
(silence) ruled supreme. Atea (light) sprang from Tanaoa, made war on him, drove him
away and confined him within limits. Ono (sound) sprang from Atea and broke up Mutuhei.
From the struggles between Tanaoa and Atea, Ono and Mutuhei, arose Atanua (shade).
</p>
<p>Atea and Ono ruled the universe together as body and spirit (<i>tino</i> and <i>uhane</i>). Atea took Atanua for wife and begat their first-born, Tumea.
</p>
<p>2. The legend of the <i>pena-pena</i>, creation, relates that Atea, the husband of Atanua, was the cause, root and begetter
of all things. (“Atea te pepenua o te Aui te Fenua.”) From him were evolved or created
the host of inferior deities, with particular attributes or occupations. On the orders
of Atea, they broke through or picked through earth and sky, <i>fenua</i> and <i>ani</i>, and the land, <i>papa</i> appeared and was planted. The winds blew from Vevau to Hawaii, and back from Hawaii
to Vevau, cooling and refreshing.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Pu te metani me Vevau
</p>
<p class="line">A-anu te tai o Hawaii
</p>
<p class="line">Pu atu te metani me Hawaii
</p>
<p class="line">A-anu te ao o Vevau
</p>
<p class="line">Nui-ia te papa e moe ana.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Atanua then conceived and bore the Night, <i>Po-nui-o-Atea</i>; after that she bore the Moon, <i>Meama</i>; after that she bore the Day-break (dawning), <i>Ata</i>; after that the Day, <i>A-nui-o-Atea</i>; and last of all was born Sound, <i>Ono-nui-o-Atea</i>. The scene of these series of creations seems to have extended from Vevau to Hawaii,
“<i>O Vevau me Hawaii</i>” forming the refrain of each act of creation.
</p>
<p>3. The legend of <i>Mauikiiki</i> relates that Mauiki was the older brother and Mau-ii was the younger. The younger
one stove a hole in the head of the older one, and thus caused the sacred fire (<i>ahi tapu</i>) to flow all over the land. Through the hole in the skull of Mauiki, the fires and
furies (<i>na ii</i>) rose up to the sky, but they were met by Kamaiko, the god of cold, who hurled them
back again; and diverting them into the rocks, the soil, etc., put them out. The lord
(<i>te fatu</i>) then gave to Mauiki a wife called Hina-te-Ao-ihi, or Hina-te-Ao-Tuakiina. When Mauiki
feels wrathy and furious his inwards are soon cooled by strong winged winds, <i>na metani si keheu</i>; Mauiki having thus been quieted and peace restored, Atea proceeds with the work
of creation, and all manner of animals, big and small, are created.
</p>
<p>4. The legend <i>Taikoko</i> (the flood) states that the sea was rising; a house was built on the ocean for the
preservation of life and animals; that the animals were marshalled by one man before
and one man behind, the former called Fetu-Amo-Amo, the latter Ia-Fetu-Tini.
</p>
<p>The following individuals are mentioned: Hina-touti-Ani, Hina-te-Ao-ihi and <span class="pageNum" id="pb264">[<a href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>Hina-te-Ao-Meha, females; Fetu-Moana, Fetu-Mau-Ani, Fetu-Amo-Amo and Ia-Fetu-Tini,
males.
</p>
<p>A turtle was sacrificed, and then the rain came in a cataclysm. After a while dry
land appeared, and the vessel of Tanaoa, <i>teetina o Tanaoa</i>, appeared on the sea of Hawaii, whose mountain ridges began to shoot up out of the
water. After that the <i>teetina o Moepo</i> appeared over the sea of Hawaii, land rose up more and more in Hawaii and Matahou
and all were safely landed.
</p>
<p>5. The Legends of the <i>Take</i>. The Marquesans call themselves the descendants from the <i>Take o Take-hee-hee</i>, their immediate progenitor being Tani, one of the twelve sons of Toho or the original
Take. Having had commotions and wars among themselves, they were driven out of Take-hee-hee
or Aheetake, as it is called in another legend. There are two accounts of the migrations
of the Takes. They run in this wise:

<p>6. The following are the chiefs or founders who led the Take during their migrations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Makoiko founded the settlement Ahee-tai.
</li>
<li>Koui (k) and Koutea (w) founded the settlement Ao-nuu.
</li>
<li>Atea and Atanua founded the settlement Papanui.
</li>
<li>Papa-tana-oa and Heihei-tona founded the settlement Take-hee.
</li>
<li>Tani-oa-anu and Taneoa-ani founded the settlement Ani-tai.
</li>
<li>Tonafiti and Mawena founded the settlement Hawaii.
</li>
<li>Moepo and Taunea founded the settlement Tuuma.
</li>
<li>Ono-tapu and Moe-oe-ihea founded the settlement Meaai.
</li>
<li>Manuio and Atoomai founded the settlement Matahou.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>Some of the above lands are thus described:
</p>
<p>Aheetai was a mountain land, with a settlement at Taiao, another at Meini-takahua,
and another near the water (lake or river) of Nuu-taea.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb265">[<a href="#pb265">265</a>]</span></p>
<p>Aonuu is called in the mele:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">He henua hiwaoa mei Aheetai
</p>
<p class="line">He henua hiwahiwa Aomai.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Faaina ruled in Aonuu, and after him Anu-o-Aatuna. Afterwards the chief Atea killed
Umai and civil wars drove him and many other <i lang="haw">Take</i> to seek new homes in other lands.
</p>
<p>Papanui is called a high table land, near the sea, <i lang="haw">vipua me te tai</i>. Among the fugitives from Aonuu was a chief Tiki-Matohe and his wife Hina. They left
with their followers and outfit of pigs, fowl and fruits in a double canoe, <i lang="haw">vaka hupu</i>, and discovered the land of Papanui. The mele of Tani’s landing on Papanui states
that the host Atea would, in honor of Tani, bring pigs from Ao-tumi, turtle from Ono-tapu
and fowls from below Ii hawa and Nuu-teea.
</p>
<p>Take-hee is called: “<i lang="haw">Tu hivaoa eeke i te hee</i>.”
</p>
<p>Anitai or Anitake. Of this it is said: “<i lang="haw">A kau papaua ia tai naenae</i>.”
</p>
<p>Hawaii is called: “<i lang="haw">Tai mamao uta oa tu te Ii</i>.” In Hawaii the <i lang="haw">hupe</i>, <i lang="haw">kohanui</i>, <i lang="haw">mio</i> and <i lang="haw">temanu</i> trees were growing. Hawaii appears to have been subject to tremendous hurricanes,
followed by famines. The following headlands or capes are mentioned in Hawaii: Fiti-tona-tapu,
Pua, Ao, Ao-ena and Ao-oma. The <i lang="haw">mio</i> tree was said to make good paddles. Two mountains are mentioned in Hawaii; one in
the mele of Matahou of Hawaii, called Mouna-Tika-oe; the other in the mele of Tupaa,
called Mauna-oa. The latter is said to have been raging (<i lang="haw">ii</i>) on top and served as a landmark for Tupaa when he left Hawaii with his family and
followers.
</p>
<p>Tuuma is said to have been near to Hawaii: “<i lang="haw">Te Tuuma i Hawaii tata ae</i>.”
</p>
<p>Meaai: All that is said of this island is: “<i lang="haw">Mou ae te tupa tata eke na te tai</i>.”
</p>
<p>Matahou is the last land <span class="corr" id="xd32e12895" title="Source: mentionad">mentioned</span> in this mele, and no other description given of it, than that it stood in the sea,
“<i lang="haw">tu i te tai</i>.”
</p>
<p>Throughout these migrations the <i lang="haw">Take</i> are represented as having come from below (<i lang="haw">mai iao</i>), when coming from Aheetake, and going up (<i lang="haw">uka</i>) to Matahou.
</p>
<p>Throughout the Polynesian groups, within the tropics, when a land is spoken of as
<i lang="haw">iao ilalo</i>, <i lang="haw">iraro</i> of the speaker’s place, it invariably means to the leeward, before the prevailing
trade wind. This wind being from northeast or southeast, these migrations pursued
a course from west to east, which suggests a descent from Asia or the Asiatic Archipelago.
</p>
<p>The word <i lang="haw">take</i>, as expressing a nation or a race, is probably an archaism of the Polynesian language;
its condensed and modern form being <i lang="haw">tai</i>, as I find the latter form used interchangeably with the former in some of the meles,
as Aai-tai for Ani-take, Ahee-tai for Ahee-take. The word <i lang="haw">tai</i> occurs with the same meaning in the Tonga Islands, where this expression is common—<i lang="haw">Kai Fiti</i>, Viti people: <i lang="haw">Kai Tonga</i>, Tonga people; in Hawaiian, <i lang="haw">kakai</i>, a family. The older word, <i lang="haw">take</i>, is found, however, in several places: “Ai-tu-take,” an island of the Hervey group,
and “Oni-take,” a place on said island; “Vaetake,” a bay in Uahuka, one of the Marquesas
Islands.
</p>
<p>In the mele of <i lang="haw">Te mohoina o Papanui</i>, Tiki is called the first man: “<i lang="haw">O Tiki to matou Motua, oia te enate mua</i>”: This is Tiki Matoho and his wife Hina, or Tiki Matoho is a namesake of the first
Tiki.

<p class="first center">COMPILED AND CONDENSED IN ENGLISH<br>
FROM<br>
KEPELINO AND S.&nbsp;M. KAMAKAU.
</p>
<p>According to an old Hawaiian tradition the <i lang="haw">alii</i> of the genealogy direct from Kane were called “<i lang="haw">ka hoalii</i>” and “<i lang="haw">he ’lii poni ia</i>” (anointed chiefs), anointed with the “<i lang="haw">wai niu a Kane</i>,” and thus became “<i lang="haw">na ’lii kapu-akua</i>.” The chiefs below them in rank were called “<i lang="haw">he ’lii noa</i>” (not anointed), but were still chiefs of the “<i lang="haw">iku-nuu</i>,” they could succeed to the government of the land and were then called “<i lang="haw">he Moi</i>.”
</p>
<p>The chiefs (<i lang="haw">ka hoalii</i>) had both temporal and spiritual power. Their genealogy (<i lang="haw">papa alii</i>) was called “<i lang="haw">iku-pau</i>,” because it alone led up to the end or beginning of all the genealogies; no one
reached further back than theirs. The chiefs of the “<i lang="haw">papa iku-nuu</i>” could only have temporal power and be recipients of the ordinary “<i lang="haw">kapu-alii</i>” awarded to other chiefs according to rank, whereas “<i lang="haw">ka hoalii</i>” enjoyed both the “<i lang="haw">kapu-akua</i>” and the “<i lang="haw">kapu-alii</i>.”
</p>
<p>This often brought on dissensions and enmities between the chiefs of the <i lang="haw">papa iku-nuu</i> and those of <i lang="haw">iku-pau</i>. The former would often introduce the ancestors of the <i lang="haw">iku-pau</i> upon their genealogies in order that they might be considered as springing from the
<i lang="haw">kapu-akua</i> race and become also “<i lang="haw">ka hoalii</i>” of the “<i lang="haw">nuu-pau</i>” and “<i lang="haw">iku-pau</i>.”
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The worshipers of Kane were called “<i lang="haw">he papa laa</i>” or “<i lang="haw">he papa Kane</i>.” Those who worshiped images were called “<i lang="haw">he pae kii</i>,” and those who worshiped nobody were called “<i lang="haw">he laa-luau</i>.” The “<i lang="haw">laa-luau</i>” were godless people, and in the time of Wakea and Papa, the first chiefs of the
<i lang="haw">iku-nuu</i> in this country, a number of worthless kapus were introduced to support the wickedness
of Wakea.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>In very olden times no human sacrifices were offered to Kane. “<i lang="haw">He kapu ke kanaka na Kane</i>” was the settled law of that time, because the kanaka was considered sacred to Kane
and like unto him. The idol-worshipers, and the followers of the “<i lang="haw">lii noa</i>” (not of the Hoalii race) offered human sacrifices.

<p class="first">The head of the first kanaka was created from a whitish clay (<i lang="haw">palolo</i>), which was brought by Lono from the four ends of the world—from “Kai Koolau, Kai
Kona, Kahiki-ku, Kahiki-moe”—north, south, east, west. The clay from the north and
east forming the right side, and the clay from the south and west forming the left.
</p>
<p>It was contrary to the worship of Kane to bury a corpse without previous purification
and prayer (<i lang="haw">Kaiolena a me pule</i>), because the kanaka was derived from the water (<i lang="haw">unuhi ia no loko mai o ka wai</i>)—muddy water—and the gods sang over him at the creation.
</p>
<p>At the creation of man, Kane was the model after which he was made; Ku was the workman
who made him, and Lono assisted generally. When the clay-image of Kane was made, they
three breathed into its nose, and that breath was called “<i lang="haw">he maule o Lono</i>.” The gods then called on him to rise and become a living being, with this formula:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Kane: “<span lang="haw">I hana au i keia lepo la; Hiki au e ola!</span>”
</p>
<p class="line">Ku and Lono: (respond) “<span lang="haw">Ola!</span>”
</p>
<p class="line">Kane: “<span lang="haw">I hana au inei lepo la; Hiki au e ola!</span>”
</p>
<p class="line">Ku and Lono: (respond) “<span lang="haw">Ola!</span>”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The image then rose and <span class="corr" id="xd32e13164" title="Source: knealt">knelt</span> before the gods and they called his name Honua-ula (Red Earth)—his body was made
of red earth (<i lang="haw">lepo ula</i>) and spittle (<i lang="haw">wai-nao</i>), and his head was made of the clay (<i lang="haw">palolo</i>) brought from the four ends of the earth. Another name for him was Ke Lii-Ku-Honua.
</p>
<p>After creation this man Honuaula, was given a place to live in, called in olden time
Kalana i Hauola, in later times it was called Pali-uli. So runs the legend of Kumu-Honua,
and he dwelt alone at first without a wife.
</p>
<p>The gods seeing the man without a wife, descended on earth, put him into a sleep,
took out one of his ribs (<i lang="haw">lalo puhaka</i>) and made it into a woman. They then awakened the man who found the woman on his
right side, and she was called Ke Ola Ku Honua.
</p>
<p>There are many legends about this first man, Kumu Honua. According to some, Kanaloa,
who seems to have been an evil spirit (<i lang="haw">akua ino</i>). “<i lang="haw">Ke kupu ino</i>” interfered with Kane when creating the first man, and Kanaloa started to make a
man of his own. When the earth was ready and shaped, Kanaloa called it to become alive,
but <span class="pageNum" id="pb268">[<a href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>no life came to it. Then he became very angry and said: “I will take your man and
he shall die;” and so it happened; and hence the first man got another name, Kumu-Uli—which
means a fallen chief (<i lang="haw">he ’lii kahuli</i>).
</p>
<p>The land of Kalana i Hauola was situated in Kahiki-Honua-Kele; by other traditions
it was in Mololani; by others it was in Hawaii-nui-Kuauli-Kaioo, a large and long
continent.
</p>
<p>Kane, Ku and Lono dwelt in the empty space—(this is another tradition)—“<i lang="haw">i ka lewa i o ia nei</i>,” and had no special resting place. They then created three heavens and by special
command fixed the stars and the lights therein.
</p>
<p>One tradition reports that Kanaloa was a generic name for a multitude of evil spirits,
created by Kane, who opposed him or revolted from him because they were denied the
awa, which means that they were not permitted to be worshiped; awa being a sacrificial
offering and sign of worship. These evil spirits did not prevail but were thrust out
and driven by Kane “<i lang="haw">i lalo lilo loa i ka po</i>” (down into the uttermost darkness) and the chief of these evil spirits was called
Milu, meaning the king of death; another name for him was Kanaloa, also Kanaloa o
ka oa nu-kea nui a Kane.
</p>
<p>When the heavens were made, then the earth was made. And then the Kanaloa spirits
were the first created by the gods. They were not made by hand like the first man,
but were spit out (<i lang="haw">i kuha ia</i>) by the gods.
</p>
<p>After Kumu Honua was created and placed upon his land, Kane conferred with him and
his wife and established laws for them, and the law was called “<i lang="haw">laau</i>” (the tree). The words of Kane are not fully reported in the legend; but it was afterwards
thought that the tree was the breadfruit-tree (<i lang="haw">ulu</i>) and that it grew at Honokohau, in North Kona, Hawaii; that it sprung from Kane (<i lang="haw">ua mimi ia e Kane</i>) and that its fruits have been bitter or sour from that day to this. And the <i lang="haw">wauke</i> was given to Kumu Honua for clothing, and it was sacred to Kane and grew in Keaukaha,
North Kona, Hawaii.
</p>
<p>Kanaloa seduced Kumu Honua’s wife Polo-Haina (<i lang="haw">Ke Ola Kumu Honua</i>) and she and her husband broke the laws of Kane. Kumu Honua was called <span lang="haw">Kane-Laa-uli</span> after he had broken the laws of Kane, which means, according to Hawaiian kahunas
(priests), “<i lang="haw">he akua ulia i ka laau</i>,” (the spirit who fell or was destroyed on account of the tree).
</p>
<p>Following are the names of Kumu Honua and his wife after they fell from grace: <span lang="haw">Pelo-Haena</span> (w),<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13242src" href="#xd32e13242">2</a> <span lang="haw">Ulia-Wale</span> (k), <span lang="haw">Laa-ai</span> (w), <span lang="haw">Laa-hei</span> (k), <span lang="haw">Laa-make</span> (w), <span lang="haw">Laa-uli</span> (k), <span lang="haw">Kumu-Hana</span> (w), <span lang="haw">Kumu Uli</span> (k), <span lang="haw">Kanikau</span> (w), <span lang="haw">Kani Kuo</span> (k).
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>An “<i lang="haw">au-apaapa</i>” comprises twelve generations. All who spring from any branch within these twelve
are considered as relations. An “<i lang="haw">au-apaapa</i>” extended over two to three centuries.
</p>
<p>An “<i lang="haw">au poipu</i>” consisted of twenty-four generations. Any one at this distance from the general
ancestor, springing off from any branch, was not considered a relation. The marrying
such distant branches was called “<i lang="haw">hoao-lopa</i>.” An “<i lang="haw">au-poipu</i>” extended over six or more centuries.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb269">[<a href="#pb269">269</a>]</span></p>
<p>Following are the generations from Kumu Honua to Nuu-Pule, i.e. from the creation
of man to the flood.
</p>
<p>Kumu Honua and Lalo Honua had three sons: 1. <span lang="haw">Kolo-i-ke-Ao</span>, or <span lang="haw">Laka</span>; 2. <span lang="haw">Kulu-ipo</span> or <span lang="haw">Kolo-i-ka-Po</span>; 3. <span lang="haw">Kaiki-ku-a-Kane</span>.

<p>From Kumu Honua to Laka was one “<i lang="haw">kau apaapa</i>,” and from Kumu Honua to Moolewa were two “<i lang="haw">kau apaapa</i>,” etc.
</p>
<p>Nuu built a large vessel and a house on top of it, and it was called “<i lang="haw">he Waa-Halau-Alii o ka Moku</i>.”
</p>
<p>When the flood subsided Kane, Ku and Lono entered the “<i lang="haw">Waa Halau</i>” of Nuu and told him to go out. He did so and found himself on top of Mauna Kea on
Hawaii, and he called a cave there after the name of his wife, Lili-Noe, and that
cave remains there to this day. Another name of his wife was Nuu-mea-lani.
</p>
<p>Other legends say that it was not there where Nuu landed and dwelt, but in Kahiki-Honua-Kele,
a large and extensive country.
</p>
<p>Some legends say that the rainbow was the road by which Kane descended to speak with
Nuu.
</p>
<p>Another name of <span lang="haw">Nuu</span> was <span lang="haw">Nuu-Lolo, i Mehani</span>. Still another name was Nana-Nuu (<i lang="haw">Nana</i> being the old pronunciation of <i lang="haw">Lana</i><span class="corr" id="xd32e13468" title="Source: -">—</span>floating). Also Nuu-Mea.
</p>
<p>When Nuu left his vessel he took with him a pig, coconuts and awa as an offering to
his god, Kane. As he got out of the vessel and looked up he saw the moon in the sky,
and he thought that was the god, and he said to himself: “You are Kane no doubt, though
you have transformed yourself to my sight;” so he worshipped the moon and offered
his awa, pig and coconuts. Then Kane descended again and spoke reprovingly to Nuu,
but on account of the mistake Nuu escaped punishment, having asked pardon of Kane.
Then Kane ascended to heaven and left the rainbow as a token of his forgiveness.
</p>
<p>All the previous population having been destroyed by the flood, Nuu became the second
progenitor of all present mankind. So runs the Hawaii legends, but the legends of
Oahu, Maui and Kauai differ somewhat.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span></p>
<p>After Nuu’s escape from the flood he was called by new names, such as Ku Ka Puna,
and his wife Ku Ke Koa. He had three sons: Ka Nalu Akea, Ka Nalu Hoohua and Ka Nalu
Manamana.

of God where he might find a proper place, and God replied to him: “Go, travel to
the eastward and where you find a sharp-peaked hill projecting precipitously into
the ocean, that is the hill for the sacrifice.” Then <span lang="haw">Lua Nuu</span> and his son <span lang="haw">Kupulupulu-a-Nuu</span> and his servant Pili Lua Nuu started off in their boat to the eastward; and in remembrance

<p>Hawaii Loa was the ancestor of the Hawaiian family. They were an industrious, agricultural
and fishing people. They were also very religious and worshiped Kane, Ku and Lono,
either separately, or the joint name and symbol of Ku-Kauakahi. They were therefore
called, <i>par excellence</i>, the <i lang="haw">lahui akua</i>, while all those who worshiped images and such worthless things were called <i lang="haw">lahui laa luau</i>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb272">[<a href="#pb272">272</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lua Nuu and his descendants lived to the eastward of Kalana i Hauola, on the land
called Aina Lauana a Kane and also Aina Au Apaapa a Kane until the time of Hoopale
Honua, but after the time of Newenewe Mauolina they spread far to the eastward of
the Aina Au Apaapa a Kane. From the time of Newenewe to Aniani Ku they had spread
to the eastern-most shores of Kapakapaua a Kane. In the time of Ke Kowa i Hawaii they
arrived at these (Hawaiian) islands.
</p>
<p>Several legends refer to this period between Lua Nuu and Hawaii Loa. Those of Kana
Loa and his brother Kane Apua, of Makalii, of Maui, of Kana, etc. Makalii was a celebrated
king in Kahiki Kapakapaua a Kane. During a season of great fertility he sent his messengers
all over the country and collected all the food they could get at and stored it up
in Makalii’s storehouses and forts. A famine followed, but Makalii was stingy and
had all the food gathered up in nets and hung up out of reach, and great distress
came over men and animals. The rats scoured over the earth and found no food; they
flared in the air, and there was the food. They then climbed up on the black shining
cloud of Kane—<i lang="haw">ala nui polohiwa a Kane</i>—and on the rainbow and from there they nibbled at Makalii’s nets until they broke
and tore them, so that the food fell out on the earth again; and thus was the earth
restocked with potatoes, taro, yam, etc. In remembrance of this king some stars have
been called Makalii, and the Pleiades have been called “<i lang="haw">na Huihui</i>,” in memory of Makalii’s nets of food—“<i lang="haw">na koko a Makalii</i>.”
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Kana Loa was the elder and Kane Apua was the younger brother. Their exploits are celebrated,
viz: How they overthrew the King Wahanui and how he and his died at sea, how they
conducted the Menehune people over the sea and through the wilderness until they came
to the land that Kane had given their forefathers, the “Aina i ka Houpo a Kane;” and
how they caused water to flow from the rocks, etc. Kana Loa was also called Li Hau
Ula and he was a priest (kahuna) of greater renown than any other.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The legend of Maui and how he caught the sun and made him go slower, so that his mother
might have more daylight to manufacture her <span lang="haw">kapa</span> in (<i lang="haw">akuku i ke kapa</i>), belongs to this period.
</p>
<p>In former times there were two modes of worship, or two different creeds here on Hawaii—1.
Those who worshiped the God who could not be seen;—2. Those who worshiped the God
who could be seen, natural objects, or objects made by hand.—“<i lang="haw">He Pae a Kane</i>,” “<i lang="haw">He Pae Kii</i>.”
</p>
<p>The one god (Kane) comprised three beings (<i lang="haw">ouli-wai-akua</i>)—Kane, Ku, Lono. Kane was the root or origin of gods and all created things; Ku or
Ku-ka-Pao was the workman who executed everything; Lono was the essence of wisdom,
power and incomparable attributes. One god, but viewed under three different aspects.
He was called Kane in order that man (“kane”) by being named after him should not
forget him.
</p>
<p>Before heaven and earth were created these three deities were called <span lang="haw">Kane-i-ka-Po-Loa</span>, <span lang="haw">Ku-i-ka-Po-Loa</span> and <span lang="haw">Lono-i-ka-Po-Loa</span>, and their joint name was <span lang="haw">Ke Alii Hi-ka-Po-Loa</span>, equivalent to “Almighty God.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb273">[<a href="#pb273">273</a>]</span></p>
<p>Of all the objects, animate or inanimate, natural or artificial, that were worshiped
by the <span lang="haw">pae kii</span> (idol-worshipers) the fish called <span lang="haw">Paoolekei</span> was the only one that received no worship.
</p>
<p>It was supposed that these <span lang="haw">kii</span> (images or idols) received power from being entered into and possessed by the spirits
of the dead.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>After Light had been created or brought forth from the <i lang="haw">Po</i> (the darkness or chaos) the gods looked upon the empty space (<i lang="haw">ka lewa</i>) and there was no place to dwell in. They then created the heavens for themselves.
Three heavens did they create or call into existence by their word of command. The
uppermost heaven was called “<i lang="haw">Lani-Makua</i>,” the one next below was called “<i lang="haw">he Lani o Ku</i>,” and the lowest was called “<i lang="haw">he Lani o Lono</i>.”
</p>
<p>When the heavens were made the gods found that their feet ached because there was
nothing to support them. So they created the earth for a foot-stool. Hence Kane was
called Kane Lu Honua and the earth was called “<i lang="haw">Ka honua nui a Kane</i>” and also “<i lang="haw">Keehina honua a Kane</i>.”
</p>
<p>After heaven and earth were made Kane created the big and small lights—sun, moon and
stars,—and placed them in the empty space between heaven and earth.
</p>
<p>Kane also created “<i lang="haw">i kini akua</i>” (spirits) angels or their equivalents—to act as his servants and messengers. They
were created from his spittle. They were supposed to have been created at the time
that the stars were made.
</p>
<p>The earth, sun, moon and stars were set floating in space (<i lang="haw">hoolewa ia i ka lewa</i>) by Kane and kept in their places by the power (<i lang="haw">mana</i>) of Kane.
</p>
<p>The ocean (<i lang="haw">ka moana nui a Kane</i>) surrounded the earth. It was made salt by Kane so that its waters should not stink,
and to keep it thus in a healthy and uninfected state is the special occupation of
Kane. In imitation of Kane the priests prepare waters of purification, prayer and
sanctification (holy water) “<i lang="haw">wai huikala</i>, <i lang="haw">wai lupalupa</i>, and <i lang="haw">Ke Kai olena</i>,” wherewith to drive away demons and diseases; it was called “<i lang="haw">Ka wai kapu a Kane</i>.”
</p>
<p>When the earth had been made and all things on it, man was created, as previously
stated, and he was placed on the land called Kalana i Hauola; a beautiful, fertile
land stocked with fruits and tame animals. It was also called Aina Hemolele a Kane,
also Kapakapaua a Kane. (Its situation on earth seems to have been to the east of
those who made the legend—“<i lang="haw">Kahiki-ku</i>.”)
</p>
<p>The first man, generally called Kumu Honua, had a number of names—already mentioned;
he was a tall, handsome, majestic looking person, and so was his wife. He was alone
upon the land for about one century (<i lang="haw">kipaelui</i> or <i lang="haw">kihipea</i>) before his wife Lalo Honua was created.
</p>
<p>Among the animals enumerated in the legend as dwelling in peace and comfort with <span lang="haw">Kumu Honua in Kalani i Hauola</span> were:
</p>
<p><span lang="haw">Ka puaa nui Hihimanu a Kane</span> (the large Hihimanu hog of Kane); <span lang="haw">ka ilio nui niho oi a Kane</span> (the large sharp-toothed dog of Kane); <span lang="haw">ka ilio holo i ka uaua a Lono</span> (the dog running at the voice of Lono); <span lang="haw">ka puaa maoli</span> (the common hog); <span lang="haw">ka ilio alii a <span class="pageNum" id="pb274">[<a href="#pb274">274</a>]</span>Kane</span> (the royal dog of Kane); <span lang="haw">na moo</span> (lizards); <span lang="haw">moo niho nui, niho oi, wawaka a Kane</span> (the sharp, large-toothed, iridescent lizard of Kane); <span lang="haw">ka moo olelo a Kane</span> (the talking lizard of Kane); <span lang="haw">ka moo kolo</span> (the crawling lizard); <span lang="haw">ka moo pelo a Kane</span> (the deceitful lizard of Kane); <span lang="haw">ka moo kaala</span> (the warring lizard); <span lang="haw">ka moo kaula a Kane</span> (the prophetic lizard of Kane); <span lang="haw">ka moo make a Kane</span> (the deadly lizard of Kane), etc. The moo-pelo a Kane was said to be very skillful
in lying and in the old mele he is called “<span lang="haw">he ilioha kupu ino ku o ka moku</span>.”
</p>
<p><span lang="haw">Kumu Honua</span> and his wife <span lang="haw">Lalo Honua</span> lived in <span lang="haw">Kalana i Hauola</span> until they were driven out by “<span lang="haw">Ka Aaia-Nukea-nui-a-Kane</span>”—the large white bird of Kane. In <span lang="haw">Kalana i Hauola</span> grew the “<i lang="haw">ulu kapu a Kane</i>” and the “<i lang="haw">ohia hemolele a Kane</i>”—(the sacred breadfruit and sacred apples.)
</p>
<p>It was thought by the priests of old that these tabued <span class="corr" id="xd32e14187" title="Source: friuts">fruits</span> were the cause of the trouble and death of <span lang="haw">Kumu Honua</span> and <span lang="haw">Lalo Honua</span>. Hence in the ancient meles the former was called <span lang="haw">Kane Laa-Uli</span>, <span lang="haw">Kumu-Uli</span>, <span lang="haw">Kulu-Ipo</span>—(the fallen chief—he who fell from, by, or on account of the tree, the mourner, etc.)
or names of similar import.
</p>
<p>The legends further relate that if strangers ate of the ripe apples of this land,
<span lang="haw">Kalana i Hauola</span>, they died forthwith, and that the native inhabitants, knowing this, never ate them.
Here also, and here alone, [grew the] “<i lang="haw">wauke kapu a Kane</i>,” the cloth which was forbidden to be worn by any but the <span lang="haw">Alii-kapu</span> who had been properly anointed by the “<i lang="haw">aila niu a Kane</i>.”
</p>
<p>Among many other names for this land was <span lang="haw">Ulu-Paupau</span>—the fruit which caused defilement and degradation. Another name was <span lang="haw">Pali-uli</span>. The legend says:
</p>
<p>“<span lang="haw">He aina kapu o Pali-uli. He aina hemolele. He hoopololei ka loaa o ua aina la. He
hoiu kapu loa ka hoomakaukau ana, i mea e loaa ’i ua aina la. Ina hewa, aole no e
loaa ana. Ina e nana i hope, aole no e loaa. Ina e aloha i ka ohana, aole no e komo
i Pali-uli</span>” (A sacred land is Pali-uli, a holy land. One must be righteous to attain it; he
must prepare himself exceedingly holy who wishes to reach that land. If sinful he
will not get there; if he looks behind he will not get there; if he prefers his family
he will not enter in Pali-uli). Says the chant:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="haw" class="lg">
<p class="line">O Pali-uli, aina huna a Kane
</p>
<p class="line">O ka aina i Kalana i Hauola.
</p>
<p class="line">I Kahiki-ku, i Kapakapaua a Kane.
</p>
<p class="line">O ka aina i kumu, i lali.
</p>
<p class="line">O ka aina ai nui a ke Akua.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">O Pali-uli, hidden land of Kane,
</p>
<p class="line">Land in Kalana i Hauola,

<p class="line">In Kahiki-ku, in Kapakapaua of Kane,

<p class="first"><span lang="haw">Ulu Kaa</span> was another name for <span lang="haw">Kalana i Hauola</span>. <span lang="haw">Aina Huna a Kane</span>, another name. Also <span lang="haw">Aina a Kane Huna Moku</span>; <span lang="haw">Aina Kapu a Kane</span>; <span lang="haw">Aina Elieli a Kane</span>, and <span lang="haw">Aina i ka Houpo o Kane</span>. This land or Paradise was the central part of the world—“<i lang="haw">ke <span class="pageNum" id="pb275">[<a href="#pb275">275</a>]</span>kiko waena</i>”—and situated in <span lang="haw">Kahiki-ku</span> which was a large and extensive continent. It was also called <span lang="haw">Aina Eepa a Kane</span>; <span lang="haw">Aina wai-Akua a Kane</span>; also <span lang="haw">Kahiki-ku</span>.
</p>
<p><span lang="haw">Kahiki-ku</span> was also called Aina apaapaa a Kane on account of its size and vast dimensions. It
was situated to the eastward, and it was there where the gods commenced their creations,
hence in olden times the sun (<i lang="haw">ka la</i>) was called “<i lang="haw">he Alanui hele a Kane</i>,” and the west was called “<i lang="haw">he Alanui o ka make</i>.”
</p>
<p>In olden times the front of the dwelling houses was turned to the east, as a sign
of the Kane worship; and one door or opening was turned to the west in remembrance
of <span lang="haw">Hawaii-Loa</span> or, as he is called <span lang="haw">Ke Kowa i Hawaii</span>, who came from the westward and discovered or settled on Hawaii, and afterwards returned
to the westward, going to <span lang="haw">Kahiki-ku</span>.
</p>
<p><span lang="haw">Kalana i Hauola</span> was also called <span lang="haw">Aina Luana</span> or <span lang="haw">Aina Lauana a Kane</span>; also the <span lang="haw">Aina wai ola a Kane</span>. This “<i lang="haw">wai ola</i>” or living water was a running stream, or overflowing spring (<i lang="haw">wai kahe</i>), attached to or enclosed in a pond (<i lang="haw">loko</i>). It was a beautiful transparent clear water. The banks of the pond were splendid.
It had three outlets, one for Ku, one for Kane and one for Lono, and through these
outlets the fish entered in the pond. If the fish of the pond were thrown on the ground
or on the fire, they did not die. If a man had been killed and was sprinkled over
with this water he would soon come to life again. According to the ancient worship
of Hawaii water and salt were objects of special solicitude. The priests mixed water
and salt and prayed over it and it then became a sort of Holy water, a water of purification
etc. in remembrance of the pond of living water in the Aina wai ola a Kane.
</p>
<p>That land was also called the <span lang="haw">Aina wauke kapu a Kane</span>, because that wauke was planted by <span lang="haw">Kane</span> for clothing for the first people, <span lang="haw">Lepo Ahulu</span> (k) and <span lang="haw">Lalo Ahulu</span> (w)—<span lang="haw">Kumu Honua</span> and <span lang="haw">Lalo Honua</span>.
</p>
<p>This land was also called “<i lang="haw">Aina wai lepolepo o kumu honua a Kane</i>,” because man was formed out of moistened earth. When man was formed, Ku and Kane
spat in his nostrils, and Lono spat in his mouth, and the earth model became a living
being. This name was also applied to the entire earth as well as to the particular
“<span lang="haw">Kalana i Hauola</span>.” When people died they were said to have gone to the muddy waters of Kane (“<i lang="haw">ua hoi i ka wai lepolepo a Kane</i>.”) In its wider sense, as the residence of Kumu Honua, after he was turned out of
<span lang="haw">Kalani i Hauola</span>, it applied to the land adjoining the latter. In this sense it was also called “<span lang="haw">Aina kahiko a Kane</span>.” It was situated to the eastward of <span lang="haw">Kalana i Hauola</span>, because the chants, prayers, and legends attest that the emigrants from there found
land in going to the eastward and that new land they called “<i lang="haw">na Aina i kulana kai maokioki a Kane</i>” and that great ocean “<i lang="haw">Ka Moana kai maokioki a Kane</i>,” and also “<i lang="haw">Ka Moana kai Popolo</i>.” And it is equally certain that when they returned to the <span lang="haw">Aina Kahiko</span> or to <span lang="haw">Kahikiku</span> they shaped their course to the westward.
</p>
<p>When Kumu Honua was turned out of <span lang="haw">Kalana i Hauola</span>, he went to live on an island or in a district, which was called after him Kumu Honua
Mokupuni. He afterwards returned to the mainland of Kapakapaua a Kane and there he
died and was buried on top of a high hill called Kumu Honua Puu, where multitudes
of his descendants were also buried. And when in after ages room became scarce in
that cemetery only the bones of the head and of the back-bone (“<i lang="haw">na auhau</i>”) were buried there, and hence it was <span class="pageNum" id="pb276">[<a href="#pb276">276</a>]</span>called Ka Puu Poo Kanaka. It was also called after the various names of Kumu Honua.
</p>
<p>[Original notes break at this point, one or more pages probably lost.]
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>2. Laka. The eldest son of Kumu Honua and Lalo-Honua (w), was also called Kuewa (the
vagabond). He killed his younger brother Ahu, and from that time he was called Kolo-i-ke-Ao.
He was a bad man and progenitor of the irreligious and godless.
</p>
<p>2. Ahu, second son of Kumu Honua, a pious man, built altars and worshiped God. His
brother Laka envied him and killed him. He died without leaving any offspring. His
other names were Kulu-ipo, and Kolo-i-ka-Po.
</p>
<p>2. Kapili, also called Kaiki-ku-a-Kane, was the third son of Kumu Honua. He was a
pious man, a kahuna and progenitor of the true worshipers.
</p>
<p>4. Ka Wa Kupua. He first organized the order of prophets, soothsayers and magicians.
</p>
<p>6. Ake Nui. He was born to the eastward of Kapakapaua-a-Kane and his parents moved
to a far off place on account of a famine in their own land.
</p>
<p>7. Ka Mauli Newenewe Loa. He attained the greatest age of all mankind: four “<i lang="haw">Kipaelui</i>” (four hundred years.)
</p>
<p>7. Ke Ola i Mauolina a Kane. The most upright and pious man of his time. Hence he
was taken away alive from earth and did not die.
</p>
<p>8. Ka Lei Lani. He also was remarkable for his piety, and he also was taken away from
earth alive by God.
</p>
<p>9. Haule i Honua. He was a warrior of renown, and his generation was signalized for
skill in war and politics. He moved to or invaded a country south of Kapakapaua-a-Kane
called Ku Lalo, or Ka Honua i Lalo, where a warlike people dwelt, who are described
in the legend as “<i lang="haw">he poe poa a me ka pakaha wale</i>” (terms of opprobrium).
</p>
<p>11. Lalo o Kona. He was born in that southern land, Ka Honua i Lalo, and hence his
name.
</p>
<p>12. Hoo Nanea. He was also born in Honua i Lalo, but afterwards he returned to the
land of his ancestors (Kapakapaua-a-Kane) and died there.
</p>
<p>13. Nuu. He was born to the eastward of Kapakapaua-a-Kane. He was a pious and God-fearing
man. In his time came the flood, Kai a Kahinalii. By command of God he built a vessel
called, “<i lang="haw">He waa Halau Alii o ka Moku</i>,” in which he and his escaped.
</p>
<p>14. Nalu Akea. He is called the progenitor of the people living on the main land of
Kane, “<i lang="haw">aina kumu paa a Kane</i>.”
</p>
<p>14. Nalu Hoohua. He is called the progenitor of “<i lang="haw">ka poe kekea</i>” (clear skinned). That race of people were called a warlike, proud and quarrelsome
people. They did not travel or propagate themselves among the lands of the ocean (<i lang="haw">aina moana</i>), but dwelt to the westward of Kapakapaua-a-Kane. Therefore the firstborn of Nalu-Hoohua
was called Hakui Lani and also Kui ka Ewa Honua.
</p>
<p>14. Nalu Manamana. The third and favorite son of Nuu. He is the progenitor of the
pure white people (<i lang="haw">Ka poe keokeo maoli</i>).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb277">[<a href="#pb277">277</a>]</span></p>
<p>A variation in the legend of Nalu-Akea gives him the following descendants:

<p>15. Ka Io Lani. In his time the worship of Kane was yet pure and unmixed with idolatry.
</p>
<p>17. Ka Neenee Lani. Celebrated for his knowledge of astronomy and soothsaying. He
was a pious man.
</p>
<p>18. Honua o ka Moku. Renowned for agriculture and industry.
</p>
<p>20. Hele i kua Hikina. In his time this race began to move to the eastward of Kapakapaua-a-Kane.
</p>
<p>21. Hele Moo Loa. In his time the race moved to the eastern border of the main land
and dwelt there as strangers.
</p>
<p>22. Ke Ao Apaapaa. The race was now settled on the eastern border of Kapakapaua-a-Kane
and were pursuing agriculture, fishing and other industrial pursuits.
</p>
<p>23. Lua Nuu. He was first called Kane Hoa Lani, but, becoming renowned, he was called
Lua Nuu, i.e., the second Nuu. He was also called Kini, and Kinikini. He by command
of God first introduced circumcision to be practiced among all his descendants. He
left his native home and moved a long way off until he reached a land called Honua
i Lalo (the southern country); hence he got the name Lalo-Kona, and his wife was called
Honua-Po-i-Lalo. He was the father of Ku Nawao by his slave-woman Ahu, and of Ka lani
Menehune by his wife Mee Hiwa.
</p>
<p>24. Ku Nawao. He was the progenitor of the people called “<i lang="haw">Ka Poe Mu-ai Maia</i>” and also “<i lang="haw">Laau-Haeleele</i>.” He was the oldest son of Lua Nuu and became a wanderer in the Desert.
</p>
<p>24. Ka Lani Menehune. He was the father of Aholoholo and Ka Imi Puka Ku, who were
twins. Through his cunning and adroitness (<i lang="haw">maalea</i>) the younger brother, Ka Imi Puka Ku, obtained the affection of his father and was
aggrandized by him. His wife came from the east of Kapakapaua-a-Kane and was related
to him.
</p>
<p>25. Aholoholo, was renowned for his swiftness.
</p>
<p>25. Ka Imi Puka Ku, or Kini-Lau-a-Mano. He had twelve children, from the youngest
of whom sprang the Hawaiian people.
</p>
<p>26. Ka Hekili Paapaaina, <span class="corr" id="xd32e14502" title="Source: Newenewene">Newenewe</span> i Maolina. The oldest and the youngest of Kinilau’s children. The former is said
to be the progenitor of the “<i lang="haw">alii kapu</i>,” and the latter of the “<i lang="haw">alii wohi</i>.” But the two dignities were united through their children in this wise:

<p>29. Aniani ka Lani. In his time this race had got far from the original homesteads.
He is quoted by both Tahitian and Hawaiian legends as a progenitor (<i lang="haw">ku-puna</i>) of their nations.
</p>
<p>30. Hawaii Loa, or Ke Kowa i Hawaii. He was one of the four children of Aniani ka
Lani. The other three were Ki, who settled in Tahiti, Kana Loa and Laa-Kapu. In his
time this ocean was called Kai Holo-o-ka-Ia. It was so called by Hawaii Loa, and at
that time there existed only the two islands of Hawaii and of Maui, discovered by
him, the first of which was called after himself, and the second was named after his
oldest son. The other islands of this group are said to have been hove up from the
sea by volcanoes during and subsequent to the time of Hawaii Loa. These two large
islands were then uninhabited. Hawaii Loa and his followers were the first inhabitants.
</p>
<p>Hawaii Loa and his brothers were born on the east coast of a country called Ka Aina
kai Melemele a Kane (the land of the yellow or handsome sea). Hawaii Loa was a distinguished
man and noted for his fishing excursions which would occupy sometimes months, sometimes
the whole year, during which time he would roam about the ocean in his big vessel
(<i lang="haw">waa</i>), called also a ship (<i lang="haw">he moku</i>), with his people, his crew and his officers and navigators (“<i lang="haw">Poe hookele</i>” and “<i lang="haw">Kilo-hoku</i>.”)
</p>
<p>One time when they had thus been long out on the ocean, Makalii, the principal navigator,
said to Hawaii Loa: “Let us steer the vessel in the direction of Iao, the Eastern
Star, the discoverer of land (<i lang="haw">Hoku hikina kiu o na aina</i>.) There is land to the eastward, and here is a red star ‘<i lang="haw">hoku ula</i>’ (Aldebaran) to guide us, and the land is there in the direction of those big stars
which resemble a bird (<i lang="haw">e kapa mai nei me he manu la</i>.)” And the red star, situated in the lap of the goats (<i lang="haw">i ka poli o na kao</i>) was called Makalii after the navigator’s name. And some other red stars in the circle
of the Pleiades (<i lang="haw">ma ka ponaha o na huhui</i>) were called the Huhui-a-Makalii.
</p>
<p>So they steered straight onward and arrived at the easternmost island (<i lang="haw">ka moku hikina loa</i>.) They went ashore and found the country fertile and pleasant, filled with awa, coconut
trees, etc., and Hawaii Loa, the chief, called that land after his own name. Here
they dwelt a long time and when their vessel was filled with food and with fish, they
returned to their native country with the firm intention to come back to Hawaii-nei
which they preferred to their own country. They had left their wives and children
at home; therefore they returned to fetch them.
</p>
<p>And when they arrived at their own country and among their relations, they were detained
a long time before they set out again for Hawaii.
</p>
<p>At last Hawaii Loa started again, accompanied by his wife and his children and dwelt
in Hawaii and gave up all thought of ever returning to his native land. He was accompanied
also in this voyage by a great multitude of people (<i lang="haw">ka lehulehu</i>), steersmen, navigators, shipbuilders and this and that sort of people. Hawaii Loa
was chief of all this people, and he alone brought his wife and children. All the
others came singly without women. Hence Hawaii Loa is called the special progenitor
of this nation.
</p>
<p>On their voyage hither the Morning Star (<i lang="haw">ka Hoku Loa</i>) was the special star that they steered by. And Hawaii Loa called the islands after
the names of his children and the stars after his navigators and steersmen.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb279">[<a href="#pb279">279</a>]</span></p>
<p>After Hawaii Loa had been some time in this country (Hawaii nei), he made another
voyage to find his brothers, and to see if they had any children who might become
husbands or wives for his own. On this voyage he fell in with his younger brother
Ki, on the island of Tahiti, where Ki had settled and called it after one of his own
names. Then Hawaii Loa and Ki sailed together to the southward (<i lang="haw">i ka mole o ka honua</i>), there they found an uninhabited island which Hawaii Loa called after his own name,
and another smaller island which he called after his daughter, “Oahu.”
</p>
<p>When they had finished their business here they returned to Hawaii and the Hoku-Iwa
stars and the Hoku Poho ka Aina, were those that they steered by. On his outward voyage
from Hawaii the star called Ke Alii o Kona-i-ka-Lewa and the stars of the Hoku-kea
o ka Mole Honua (Southern Cross) were those by which he shaped his course for Tahiti
and those other islands. They left from Lae o Kalae in Kau (south cape of Hawaii),
and thither they returned.
</p>
<p>When Hawaii Loa thus returned he brought with him Tu-nui-ai-a-te-Atua the first-born
son of his brother Ki, and he became the husband of his favorite daughter Oahu. These
two had afterwards a child called Ku Nui Akea who was born at Keauhou, in Puna, Hawaii.
Puna was then a fertile and fine country and it was called Puna by Ku nui ai a ke
Akua after his own birthplace, Puna-Auia, in Tahiti.
</p>
<p>32. Kunuiakea, on both father’s and mother’s side became a chief of the very highest
rank (<i lang="haw">kapu loa</i>). From him sprang the race of chiefs here in Hawaii (<i lang="haw">welo alii</i>), and from Makalii sprang the race of the common people (<i lang="haw">welo kanaka</i>). The first has been kept separate from the most ancient times, and the second has
been kept separate from the time of chaos (<i lang="haw">mai ka Po mai</i>). But the priestly race (<i lang="haw">welo kahuna</i>) was one and the same with the race of chiefs from the beginning.
</p>
<p>When Hawaii Loa arrived here, as before observed, there were only the two islands
of Hawaii-Loa and of Maui-ai-Alii; but during his time and close afterwards the volcanoes
on Hawaii and on Maui began their eruptions; and earthquakes and convulsions produced
or brought to light the other islands.
</p>
<p>Kunuiakea’s son Ke Lii Alia, and his grandson Kemilia, were born at Tahiti along with
the Aoa, the royal tree; but his great grandson, Ke Lii Ku (Eleeleualani), was born
on Hawaii.
</p>
<p>35. Eleeleualani was the grandfather of Papa-Nui-Hanau-Moku (w). His wife was called
Ka Oupe Alii and was a daughter of Kupukupunuu from Ololoimehani (supposed to be either
a name for the island of Nuuhiwa, or of a place on that island). They had a son called
Kukalani-ehu, whose wife was Ka Haka-ua-Koko, the sixth descendant from Makalii, and
they two were the parents of Papa-Nui (w).
</p>
<p>37. Papa-Nui-Hanau-Moku (w). She first married Wakea, who was the son of Kahiko (k)
and Tupu-rana-i-te-hau (w) who was a Tahitian woman. Papa’s first child with Wakea
was a daughter called Hoohokukalani.
</p>
<p>Papa, having quarreled with Wakea on account of their daughter, went to Tahiti and
there she took to Te Rii Fanau for husband and had a son called Te Rii i te Haupoipoi.
She afterwards returned to Hawaii under the name of Huhune and had a son with Waia
and called his name Hinanalo. Domestic troubles now made her crazy and she returned
to Tahiti where she had another son with Te Arii Aumai, who was said to <span class="pageNum" id="pb280">[<a href="#pb280">280</a>]</span>be the fourth generation of the Tahiti chiefs, and she called his name Te Arii Taria,
and he became chief over that part of Tahiti called Taharuu.
</p>
<p>It is thus on account of her being the mother of chiefs, both here and in Tahiti that
she is called Papa Nui Hanau Moku. She is said to have been a comely, handsome woman,
very fair and almost white.
</p>
<p>Papa is said to have traveled eight times between Tahiti and Hawaii, and died in a
place called Waieri, in Tahiti, during the time of Nanakehili, the fifth descendant
from her and Wakea.
</p>
<p>37. Wakea was a wicked and bad man. He instituted the bad and oppressive kapus, such
as that men and women could not eat together; that women could not eat red fish, hogs,
fowl or other birds, and some kinds of bananas. These kapus were put on to spite and
worry Papa, on account of her growling at and reproaching him for his wickedness.
Wakea also departed from the ancient worship and introduced idol worship, and many
people followed him, because they were afraid of him.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Hawaii Loa was born on the eastern shore of the land of Kapakapaua-a-Kane. One of
Hawaii Loa’s grandchildren was called Keaka-i-Lalo (w) whom he married to Te Arii
Aria, one of his brother Ki’s grandchildren, and he placed them at Sawaii, where they
became the ancestors of that people, Sawaii being then called Hawaii-ku-lalo.
</p>
<p>Afterwards Hawaii Loa revisited Tahiti and found that his brother Ki had forsaken
the religion in which they were brought up, that of Kane, Ku and Lono, and adopted
Ku-waha-ilo, the man-eating God, (<i lang="haw">ke Akua ai kanaka</i>) as his God. After quarreling with his brother on this account, Hawaii Loa left Tahiti
and brought with him Te Arii Apa as a husband for Eleeleualani, his <i lang="haw">moopuna</i> (grandchild). From these two was born Kohala (w), a girl, from whom the Kohala people
sprang.
</p>
<p>Afterwards Hawaii Loa went again to Tahiti and Hawaii-ku-lalo (Sawaii) and held a
meeting with those peoples at Tarawao, but finding that they persisted in following
after the God Ku-waha-ilo and that they had become addicted to man-eating, he reproved
and repudiated them, and passed a law called he Papa Enaena, forbidding anyone from
Hawaii-Luna (this present Hawaii) from ever going to the southern islands, lest they
should go astray in their religion and become man-eaters.
</p>
<p>When Hawaii Loa returned from this trip he brought with him Te Arii Tino Rua (w) to
be a wife to Ku-Nui-Akea, and they begat Ke Alii Maewa Lani, a son, who was born at
Holio in North Kona, Hawaii, and became the Kona progenitor.
</p>
<p>After this Hawaii Loa made a voyage to the westward, and Mulehu (Hoku Loa) was his
guiding star. He landed on the eastern shore of the land of the Lahui-maka-lilio (the
people with the turned up eyes oblique). He traveled over it to the northward and
to the westward to the land of Kuahewahewa-a-Kane, one of the continents that God
created, and thence he returned, by the way he had come, to Hawaii nei, bringing with
him some white men (<i lang="haw">poe keokeo kane</i>) and married them to native women (<i lang="haw">a hoo-moe i koonei poe wahine</i>). On this return voyage the star Iao was his guiding star to Hawaii.
</p>
<p>After this Hawaii Loa made another voyage to the southern and eastern shore <span class="pageNum" id="pb281">[<a href="#pb281">281</a>]</span>of Kapakapaua-a-Kane, and took with him his grandchild Ku-Nui-Akea in order to teach
him navigation, etc. When they had stayed there long enough they returned and Ku-Nui-Akea
brought with him “<i lang="haw">he mau haa elua</i>” (two stewards) one called Lehua and the other Nihoa, and they were settled on the
two islands which bear their names, as <i lang="haw">konohiki</i> (land stewards) and put under the charge of Kauai, the youngest son of Hawaii Loa.
</p>
<p>When Hawaii Loa returned from the conference with his brother Ki and his descendants,
his wife Hualalai bore him a son who was called Hamakua, and who probably was a bad
boy (<i lang="haw">keiki inoino</i>), for so his name would indicate. Ten years after this (<i lang="haw">ke Au puni</i>) Hualalai died and was buried on the mountain of Hawaii that has been called after
her name ever since.
</p>
<p>After Hawaii Loa was dead and gone, in the time of Ku Nui Akea, came Tahiti-nui from
Tahiti and landed at Ka-lae-i-Kahiki (the southwest point of Kahoolawe, a cape often
made by people coming from or going to Tahiti.) Tahiti-nui was a <i lang="haw">moopuna</i> of Ki, Hawaii Loa’s brother, and he settled on East Maui and died there.
</p>
<p>The descendants of Hawaii Loa and also of Ki (which are one, for they were brothers)
peopled nearly all the Polynesian islands. From Ki came the Tahiti, Bora-bora, Huahine,
Tahaa, Raiatea and Moorea [people].
</p>
<p>From Kanaloa were peopled Nukuhiwa, Uapou, Tahuata, Hiwaoa and those other islands.
Kanaloa married a woman from the man-eating people, Taeohae, from whom spring those
cannibals who live on Nuuhiwa, Fiji, Tarapara, Paumotu, and the islands in western
Polynesia—so is it reported in the Hawaiian legends and prayers—but the Hawaiian islands
and the Tahiti islands (properly speaking) did never addict themselves to cannibalism.
</p>
<p>The island of Maui was called after Hawaii Loa’s first born son.
</p>
<p>The island of Oahu was called after Hawaii Loa’s daughter, and her foster parent was
Lua, and hence the name Oahu-a-Lua.
</p>
<p>Kauai was called after Hawaii Loa’s younger son; his wife’s name was Waialeale, and
they lived on Kauai, and the mountain was called after her, because there she was
buried.
</p>
<p>And thus other islands and districts were called after the first settlers.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>In this first age, from Hawaii Loa to Wakea, the royal authority and prerogatives
were not very well defined. The chiefs were regarded more in the light of parents
and patrons (<i lang="haw">haku</i>), than as <i lang="haw">moi</i> and <i lang="haw">alii-kapu</i>, although they enjoyed all the honor and precedence due to their rank.
</p>
<p>This state of things was considerably altered by Wakea, his priest and successors,
yet even so late as the time of Kanipahu, who refused the government, it is evident
that the royal authority was not well settled in the olden times (<i lang="haw">aole he ano nui o na ’lii i ka wa kahiko loa ’ku</i>).

<h2 class="main">The Story of Kahahana.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Within the wonderful and often charming domain of History, from classic to modern
times, among so called cultured and so called barbarous peoples, few episodes are
marked with greater pathos, or, if better known, would elicit greater interest, than
the fall and death of Kahahana, King of Oahu, one of the Hawaiian Islands, about the
years 1783–85.
</p>
<p>Kahahana was high-born and royally connected. His father was Elani, one of the highest
nobles in the Ewa district on Oahu, a descendant, on the Maweke-Lakona line, of the
ancient lords of Lihue. His mother was Kaionuilalahai, a daughter of Kalanikahimakeialii,
and a sister of Peleioholani, King of Oahu, and a cousin of Kahekili, King of Maui.
Through his mother’s connections with the royal house of Maui Kahahana was brought
up from his earliest youth on Maui and became a special favorite with his uncle Kahekili.
Educated in all the athletic and warlike exercises, which it became a chief of that
period to know, Kahahana was remarkable for his personal beauty and manly bearing.
Handsome, brave and gallant, he was the idol of the Maui court and the pride of the
Oahu aristocracy, his father’s peers, who chafed under the heavy yoke of their own
King Peleioholani, and had but small confidence in his son and prospective successor
Kumahana.
</p>
<p>Though Kahekili was too reserved, some say too morose, to often share in the festivities
and entertainments which, through the presence of his sisters, his nieces and other
relatives, had made his court at Wailuku, where he mostly resided, a gathering place
and a focus for the gallant and gay of all the other isles in the group, yet Kahahana
was his <i>alter ego</i>, his <i lang="la">rex convivii</i>, whose prudence and popularity harmonized, or at least neutralized, the rival pretensions
of Kahekili’s half sister Namahana to be the leading star and the oracle of fashion
among the Hawaiian <i>noblesse</i> at her lately acquired domain in Waiehu.
</p>
<p>At these princely reunions, these royal feasts, whether at Waiehu or at Wailuku, the
palm of beauty and of woman grace was by universal accord awarded to Kekua-poi-ula-o-ka-lani,
the youngest sister of Namahana and of Kekuamanoha, of whom we shall hear more hereafter.
The legends and narratives handed down from that time have but one expression of her
surpassing beauty and winning charms, and the present writer has had the fortune to
meet more than one octogenerian Hawaiian who remembers seeing her while still, as
Queen of Oahu, she was as remarkable for her incomparable beauty, as in the days,
ten or twelve years before, when Kahahana first wooed and won her young affections.
</p>
<p>Between Kahahana and Kekuapoi it was an affair of the heart. They loved each other
like the commonest mortals and, as at that time no political or social considerations
of convenience stood in the way, the union was allowed by Kahekili, whose wards they
may be said to have been. They loved each other and, according to the custom and institutions
of the land, they became man and wife. Nothing more natural, simple or <span class="pageNum" id="pb283">[<a href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>straightforward. But the anomalous part of their married life was that in those days
of social as well as political profligacy, when a chief or a chiefess took as many
wives or husbands as he or she fancied or could maintain, Kahahana and Kekuapoi remained
true to each other with undivided affection to the end of their lives.
</p>
<p>In A.D. 1770 Peleioholani,—son of Kualii, hereditary Sovereign of the island of Oahu,
hereditary lord of several districts on Southern Kauai, and, by the grace of his god
and the strength of his spear, master and conqueror of the island of Molokai—died,
at the advanced age of ninety and upward, and was succeeded by his son Kumahana.
</p>
<p>The character of Peleioholani has been variously described in the traditions that
have come down from his time. The Hawaii and Maui traditions, or reminiscences, of
Peleioholani describe him as proud, arrogant, overbearing—proud, even beyond the most
exacting Hawaiian etiquette. Molokai traditions acknowledge his prowess as a warrior,
but are merciless in the condemnation of him as a tyrant, whose cruelty went even
a step beyond what those cruel times considered admissible. Against those two sources
of information we have the Oahu traditions which,—though they acknowledge that he
was proud, and justly so, because no bluer blood flowed in anybody’s veins than in
his and in his sister Kukuiaimakalani’s—yet assert that his cruelty towards the Molokai
chiefs was but a just punishment for their wanton and unprovoked murder <span class="corr" id="xd32e14726" title="Source: of of">of</span> his daughter Keelanihonuaiakama. But whatever his reputation on the other islands,
on Oahu he was feared as a stern monarch, but also respected as a just man, under
whom the husbandman prospered, priests and artisians were protected, and the naturally
turbulent character of the feudal nobles kept under salutary, though at times summary,
restraint. As sovereign of his island he made the customary circuits, for political
and religious purposes, at stated times; but his favorite residence, when not otherwise
occupied, was at Waikiki in the known district, where a perfect forest of coconut
trees enclosed his dwelling or palace on three sides, and the pleasant grove of kou
trees which his father had planted, threw its delicious shade on the heated sea-beach.
</p>
<p>Stern but just, Peleioholani’s reign was a blessing to his kingdom of Oahu, which
probably had never since the days of Mailekukahi stood higher in population, wealth,
and resources, than at the time of his death.
</p>
<p>The contrast between Peleioholani and his son Kumahana had no doubt been apparent
to thoughtful men long before the black kapa covered the mortal remains of the father.
Chiefs and commoners alike knew the man to whom their fealty now would be pledged.
Indolent of body, weak, fickle and avaricious of mind, Kumahana was a failure as a
sovereign, and it did not take long to ripen the public mind to that conviction. Feal
and loyal as the Oahu chiefs had always been to the Kakuhihewa family, whom for six
generations they had looked upon as their representative on the Oahu throne, yet the
weaknesses and extravagancies of Kumahana were enough in three short years to alienate
chiefs, priests, and commoners to such an extent that when Pupuka, Elani, Makaioulu
and other chiefs, in conjunction with the High-priest Kaopulupulu, called a public
meeting of chiefs and commoners, to consider the situation of the country and for
the avowed purpose of deposing Kumahana, not a voice was heard nor a spear raised
in defence of the unfortunate man who then and there was publicly decreed <span class="pageNum" id="pb284">[<a href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>incompetent and unworthy to rule the Oahu kingdom. That meeting and the manner of
the execution of its decree find few parallels in the most civilized of modern countries,
where the people had to resort to revolution to protect the best interests of their
country and their own well-being. It was a public declaration of the national <i lang="la">non possumus</i> any longer to suffer the rule of Kumahana. Its execution, through the wonderful unanimity
of the national voice, required neither “National Guards,” nor spears, nor clubs,
nor barricades to enforce it. It was a veritable <i lang="la">vox populi</i>, <i lang="la">vox Dei</i>, and the only trait of wisdom recorded of Kumahana was that he quietly submitted
to the inevitable and left for Kauai, where the relations of his mother and sister
provided a refuge for him and his family at Waimea. And to the lasting credit of those,
whose kindred only six years later were stigmatized by civilized Europe as “barbarians,”
“savages,” “cannibals,” not a drop of blood was shed in this mighty upheaval of an
entire people.
</p>
<p>Had I the powers of a Walter Scott to give the reader a description of that remarkable
assembly of Oahu notables that then and there convened for high national objects,
I gladly would do so. I would describe the preliminary meeting of the District Chiefs,
the (<i lang="haw">Ai-moku</i>), with the High Priest (<i lang="haw">Kahuna-nui</i>), presiding. I would tell of the dispatch of the High Priest’s messenger or herald,
<i lang="haw">elele</i>, around the island, convoking the chiefs and commoners to the projected assembly,
a kind of Hawaiian “Fiery Cross,” speeding from feudal hall to lowliest hamlet; his
functions, his privileges, his insignia of office, his formula of convocation. I would
describe the meeting of those thus convened; the appearance of the chiefs dressed
in their <i lang="haw">ahu-ula</i> (feather cloaks), their <i lang="haw">mahiole</i> (feather helmets), their <i lang="haw">niho palaoa</i> (necklace of whale’s tooth and human hair), their <i lang="haw">kupee</i> or <i lang="haw">pupu houka</i> (bracelets of glittering precious shells); carrying their <i lang="haw">pololu</i> (long spears), in their right hand, their <i lang="haw">pahoa</i> (dagger of hardened wood), in their <i lang="haw">malo</i>, or belt, and their <i lang="haw">newa</i> or war-club looped up under their cloak. I would describe the sturdy <i lang="haw">makaainana</i>, the commoners or freemen of the land, mustering behind their chiefs, armed with
their <i lang="haw">ihe</i>, javelins, and <i lang="haw">maa</i>, slings. But abler hands, at some not far distant day, will doubtless weave a pleasant
tale from those materials; and I proceed with the main story, from my work, “An Account
of the Polynesian Race,” Vol. II, on pages as shown:
</p>
<p>Kahahana, son of Elani, of the Ewa line of chiefs, was elected <i lang="haw">Moi</i> of Oahu in place of Kumahana, son of Peleioholani and grandson of Kualii, who had
been deposed by the Oahu chiefs as an incompetent, indolent, penurious and unlovable
chief. This occurred about the year 1773 (pp. 65, 290, 154).
</p>
<p>It is not improbable that the influence of Kahekili, King of Maui, was in Kahahana’s
favor, for in the war between Hawaii and Maui wherein the invading forces of Kalaniopuu
were all but annihilated in the battle of Waikapu commons, Kahahana and his Oahu troops
were joined with Kahekili in the defence of Maui (p. 154).
</p>
<p>In a subsequent attempt of Kalaniopuu to wrest honors from Kahekili, Kahahana is found
an ally in the defence of Lahaina, accompanied by Keaulumoku, bard and prophet who,
a few years later, composed his famous “Haui Ka Lani” chant foretelling the success
and glory of Kamehameha I (p. 156).
</p>
<p>Kaeo, King of Kauai, sent two messengers to acquaint Kahahana of Cook’s visit, <span class="pageNum" id="pb285">[<a href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>whereupon Kaopulupulu the high priest of Oahu said: “These people are foreigners;
they are surely the people that will come and dwell in this land” (p. 169).
</p>
<p>In 1779 Kahahana, the Oahu King, had but lately returned from Maui where he assisted
Kahekili in his wars against Kalaniopuu of Hawaii. The rupture between Kahekili and
Kahahana did not occur till afterward, in 1780–81 (pp. 197–8).
</p>
<p>Kauhi, of Maui, landing at Waikiki on an expedition against Oahu, was met by the chiefs
of Oahu, defeated and slain, his body exposed at the Apuakehau (Waikiki) heiau<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14807src" href="#xd32e14807">1</a>, and great indignities were committed with his bones. The memory of this great outrage
instigated his descendant, Kahekili, to the fearful massacre of the Oahu chiefs, when,
after the battle of Niuhelewai, he had defeated Kahahana and conquered the island
(p. 208).
</p>
<p>The death of Kahahana closed the autonomy of Oahu (p. 269).
</p>
<p>In order to understand the political relations between Kahekili and Kahahana, the
king of Oahu, and the causes of the war between them, it is necessary to go back to
the year 1773, when Kumahana, the son of Peleioholani, was deposed by the chiefs and
<i lang="haw">makaainana</i> of Oahu. Though Kumahana had grown-up children at the time, yet the Oahu nobles passed
them by in selecting a successor to the throne, and fixed their eyes on young Kahahana,
the son of Elani, one of the powerful Ewa chiefs of the Maweke-Lakona line, and on
his mother’s side closely related to Kahekili and the Maui royal family. Kahahana
had from boyhood been brought up at the court of Kahekili, who looked upon his cousin’s
child almost as a son of his own. What share, if any, indirectly, that Kahekili may
have had in the election of Kahahana, is not known; but when the tidings arrived from
Oahu announcing the result to Kahekili, he appears at first not to have been overmuch
pleased with it. The Oahu chiefs had deputed Kekelaokalani, a high chiefess, a cousin
to Kahahana’s mother and also to Kahekili, to proceed to Wailuku, Maui, and announce
the election and solicit his approval. After some feigned or real demurrer, Kahekili
consented to Kahahana going to Oahu, but refused to let his wife Kekuapoi-ula go with
him, lest the Oahu chiefs should ill-treat her. Eventually, however, he consented,
but demanded as a price of his consent that the land of Kualoa in Koolaupoko district
should be ceded to him, and also the <i>palaoa-pae</i> (the whalebone and ivory) cast on the Oahu shores by the sea.
</p>
<p>Hampered with these demands of the crafty Kahekili, Kahahana started with his wife
and company for Oahu, and landed at Kahaloa in Waikiki. He was enthusiastically received,
installed as Moi of Oahu, and great were the rejoicings on the occasion.
</p>
<p>Shortly after his installation, Kahahana called a great council of the Oahu chiefs
and the High Priest Kaopulupulu, and laid before them the demands of Kahekili regarding
the land of Kualoa and the <i lang="haw">palaoa-pae</i>. At first the council was divided, and some thought it was but a fair return for
the kindness and protection shown Kahahana from his youth by Kahekili; but the high
priest was strongly opposed to such a measure, and argued that it was a virtual surrender
of the sovereignty and independence of Oahu, Kualoa being one of the most sacred places
on the island, where stood the sacred drums of <i lang="haw">Kapahuula</i> and <i lang="haw">Kaahu-ulapunawai</i>, and also the sacred hill of Kauakahi-a-Kahoowaha; <span class="pageNum" id="pb286">[<a href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>and that the surrender of the <i lang="haw">palaoa-pae</i> would be a disrespect to the gods; in fact, if Kahekili’s demands were complied with,
the power of war and of sacrifice would rest with the Maui king and not with Kahahana.
He represented strongly, moreover, that if Kahahana had obtained the kingdom by conquest,
he might do as he liked, but having been chosen by the Oahu chiefs, it would be wrong
in him to cede to another the national emblems of sovereignty and independence. Kahahana
and all the chiefs admitted the force of Kaopulupulu’s arguments, and submitted to
his advice not to comply with the demands of Kahekili.
</p>
<p>Kahekili was far too good a politician to display his resentment at this refusal of
his demands, knowing well that he could not have the slightest prospects of enforcing
them by war so long as the Oahu chiefs were united in their policy, and that policy
was guided by the sage and experienced high priest Kaopulupulu. He dissembled, therefore,
and kept up friendly relations with Kahahana, but secretly turned his attention to
destroy the influence of Kaopulupulu in the affairs of Oahu, and create distrust and
enmity between him and Kahahana. In this object he is said to have been heartily advised
and assisted by his own high priest, Kaleopuupuu, the younger brother of Kaopulupulu.
Kaleopuupuu envied his brother the riches and consideration which his wisdom and skill
had obtained for him. Moreover, the warlike preparations of his brother-in-law, the
Hawaii king Kalaniopuu, cautioned him against precipitating a rupture with so powerful
an ally as the Oahu king; and Kahekili was but too glad to obtain the assistance of
Kahahana and his chiefs in the war with Kalaniopuu, 1777–78, Kahahana’s forces arriving
from Molokai just in time to share the sanguinary battle on the Waikapu common,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14837src" href="#xd32e14837">2</a> related on page 153, [Fornander, Polynesian Race, II] and the subsequent events of
that war.
</p>
<p>After the return of Kalaniopuu to Hawaii in January, 1779, Kahahana went over to Molokai
to consecrate the heiau called Kupukapuakea at Wailau, and to build or repair the
large taro patch at Kainalu known as Paikahawai. Here he was joined by Kahekili, who
was cordially welcomed and royally entertained. On seeing the fruitfulness and prosperity
of the Molokai lands, Kahekili longed to possess some of them, and bluntly asked Kahahana
to give him the land of Halawa. Kahahana promptly acceded to the request, not being
moved by the same considerations regarding the Molokai lands as those of Oahu, Molokai
having been conquered and subjected as an appanage or tributary to the Oahu crown
by Peleioholani. At this meeting, while discussing Kahahana’s previous refusal to
give Kahekili the Kualoa land and the <i lang="haw">palaoa-pae</i> on Oahu, Kahekili expressed his surprise at the opposition of Kaopulupulu, assuring
Kahahana that the high priest had offered the government and throne of Oahu to him
(Kahekili), but that out of affection for his nephew he had refused; and he intimated
strongly that Kaopulupulu was a traitor to Kahahana.
</p>
<p>The poisoned arrow hit its mark, and Kahahana returned to Oahu filled with mistrust
and suspicion of his faithful high-priest. A coolness arose between them. Kahahana
withdrew his confidence from, and slighted the advice of the high-priest, who retired
from the court to his own estate in Waialua and Waimea, and caused himself <span class="pageNum" id="pb287">[<a href="#pb287">287</a>]</span>and all his people and retainers to be tatooed on the knee, as a sign that the chief
had turned a deaf ear to his advice. It is said that during this period of estrangement
Kahahana became burdensome to the people, capricious and heedless, and in a great
measure alienated their good-will. It is said, moreover, that he caused to be dug
up dead men’s bones to make arrow-points wherewith to shoot rats—a favorite pastime
of the chiefs; and that he even rifled the tombs of the chiefs in order to make kahili
handles of their bones, thus outraging the public sentiment of the nation. That Kahahana
was imprudent and rash, and perhaps exacting, there is no doubt; and that conquered
chieftains’ bones were the legitimate trophies of the victors is equally true; but
that Kahahana would have violated the tombs of the dead—an act of the greatest moral
baseness even in those days—is hardly credible, and is probably an after exaggeration,
either by the disaffected priestly faction or by the victorious Kahekili plotters.
</p>
<p>While such was the condition on Oahu, Kahekili reconquered the district of Hana, as
already related, and, hearing of the death of Kalaniopuu and the subsequent contentions
on Hawaii, he felt secure in that direction, and seriously turned his attention to
the acquisition of Oahu. He first sent some war canoes and a detachment of soldiers
under command of a warrior chief named Kahahawai<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14852src" href="#xd32e14852">3</a> to the assistance of Keawemauhili<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14857src" href="#xd32e14857">4</a>, the then independent chief of Hilo, in his contest with Kamehameha. He next sent
his most trusted servant Kauhi to Kahahana on Oahu, with instructions to inform Kahahana
in the strictest confidence that Kaopulupulu had again offered him the kingdom of
Oahu, but that his regard for Kahahana would not allow him to accept it, and exhorting
Kahahana to be on his guard against the machinations of the high-priest. Credulous
as weak, Kahahana believed the falsehoods sent him by Kahekili, and, without confiding
his purpose to any one, he resolved on the death of Kaopulupulu. Preparations were
ordered to be made for a tour of the island of Oahu, for the purpose of consecrating
heiaus and offering sacrifices. When the king arrived at Waianae he sent for the high-priest,
who was then residing on his lands at Waimea and Pupukea, in the Koolau district,
to come to see him. It is said that Kaopulupulu was fully aware of the ulterior objects
of the king, and was well convinced that the message boded him no good; yet, faithful
to his duties as a priest and loyal to the last, he started with his son Kahulupue
to obey the summons of the king. Arrived at Waianae, Kahulupue was set upon by the
king’s servants, and, while escaping from them, was drowned at Malae.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14860src" href="#xd32e14860">5</a> Kaopulupulu was killed at Puuloa, in Ewa.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb288">[<a href="#pb288">288</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus foolishly and cruelly Kahahana had played into the hand of Kahekili, who, with
his high-priest Kaleopuupuu, had for a long time been plotting the death of Kahahana’s
ablest and wisest counsellor.
</p>
<p>Though executions <i>de par le roi</i> of obnoxious persons for political reasons were not uncommon in those days throughout
the group, and by the proud and turbulent nobility generally looked upon more as a
matter of personal ill-luck to the victim than as a public injustice, yet this double
execution, in the necessity of which few people except the credulous Kahahana believed,
greatly alienated the feelings of both chiefs and commoners from him, and weakened
his influence and resources to withstand the coming storm.
</p>
<p>The death of Kaopulupulu took place in the latter part of 1782 or beginning of 1783.
</p>
<p>As soon as Kahekili heard that Kaopulupulu was dead, he considered the main obstacle
to his acquisition of the island of Oahu to be removed, and prepared for an invasion.
He recalled the auxiliary troops under Kahahawai which he had sent to the assistance
of Keawemauhili in Hilo, and assembled his forces at Lahaina. Touching at Molokai,
on his way, he landed at Waikiki, Oahu. Among his chiefs and warriors of note on this
expedition are mentioned Kekuamanoha, Kaiana, Namakeha, Kalaikoa, Kamohomoho, Nahiolea,
Hueu, Kauhikoakoa, Kahue, Kalaninuiulumoku, Peapea, Manono-Kauakapekulani, Kalanikupule,
Koalaukane.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14875src" href="#xd32e14875">6</a> Besides his own armament, he had several double canoes furnished him by Keawemauhili
of Hilo, and by Keouakuahuula of Kau.
</p>
<p>Kahahana was at Kawananakoa, in the upper part of Nuuanu valley, when the news came
of Kahekili’s landing at Waikiki, and hastily summoning his warriors, he prepared
as best he could to meet so sudden an emergency.
</p>
<p>As an episode of this war the following legend has been preserved and may prove interesting:
When the news of the invasion spread to Ewa and Waialua, eight famous warriors from
these places, whose names the legend has retained, concerted an expedition on their
own account to win distinction for their bravery and inflict what damage they <span class="pageNum" id="pb289">[<a href="#pb289">289</a>]</span>could on Kahekili’s forces. It was a chivalrous undertaking, a forlorn hope, and wholly
unauthorized by Kahahana, but fully within the spirit of the time for personal valor,
audacity, and total disregard of consequences. The names of those heroes were Pupuka,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14895src" href="#xd32e14895">7</a> Makaioulu, Puakea, Pinau, Kalaeone, Pahua, Kauhi, and Kapukoa. Starting direct from
Apuakehau in Waikiki, where Kahekili’s army was encamped and organizing preparatory
to a march inland to fight Kahahana, the eight Oahu warriors boldly charged a large
contingent of several hundred men of the Maui troops collected at the heiau. In a
twinkling they were surrounded by overwhelming numbers, and a fight commenced to which
Hawaiian legends record no parallel. Using their long spears and javelins with marvellous
skill and dexterity, and killing a prodigious number of their enemies, the eight champions
broke through the circle of spears that surrounded them. But Makaioulu, though a good
fighter was a bad runner, on account of his short bow-legs, and he was overtaken by
Kauhikoakoa, a Maui chief. Makaioulu was soon tripped up, secured, and bound by Kauhikoakoa,
who swinging the captive up on his own shoulders, started off with him for the camp
to have him sacrificed as the first victim of the war. This affair took place on the
bank of the Punaluu taro patch, near the coconut grove of Kuakuaaka. Makaioulu, thus
hoisted on the back of his captor, caught sight of his friend Pupuka, and called out
to him to throw his spear straight at the navel of his stomach. In hopes of shortening
the present and prospective tortures of his friend, and knowing well what his fate
would be if brought alive into the enemy’s camp, Pupuka did as he was bidden, and
with an unerring aim. But Makaioulu, seeing the spear coming, threw himself with a
violent effort on one side, and the spear went through the back of Kauhikoakoa. Seeing
their leader fall, the Maui soldiers desisted from further pursuit, and the eight
champions escaped.
</p>
<p>In the beginning of 1783—some say it was in the month of January—Kahekili, dividing
his forces in three columns, marched from Waikiki by Puowaina, Pauoa, and Kapena,
and gave battle to Kahahana near the small stream of Kaheiki. Kahahana’s army was
thoroughly routed, and he and his wife Kekuapoi-ula fled to the mountains. It is related
that in this battle Kauwahine, the wife of Kahekili, fought valiantly at his side.
</p>
<p>Oahu and Molokai now became the conquest of Kahekili, and savagely he used his victory.
</p>
<p>For upwards of two years or more Kahahana and his wife and his friend Alapai<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14903src" href="#xd32e14903">8</a> wandered over the mountains of Oahu, secretly aided, fed, and clothed by the country
people, who commiserated the misfortunes of their late king. Finally, weary of such
a life, and hearing that Kekuamanoha, the uterine brother of his wife Kekuapoi-ula,
was residing at Waikele in Ewa, he sent her to negotiate with her brother for their
safety. Dissembling his real intentions, Kekuamanoha received his sister kindly and
spoke her fairly, but having found out the hiding-place of Kahahana, he sent messengers
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb290">[<a href="#pb290">290</a>]</span>Kahekili at Waikiki informing him of the fact. Kahekili immediately returned preemptory
orders to slay Kahahana and Alapai, and he sent a double canoe down to Ewa to bring
their corpses up to Waikiki. This order was faithfully executed by Kekuamanoha; and
it is said that the mournful chant which still exists in the Hawaiian anthology of
a bygone age under the name of “Kahahana” was composed and chanted by his widow as
the canoe was disappearing with her husband’s corpse down the Ewa lagoon on its way
to Waikiki.
</p>
<p>The cruel treachery practised on Kahahana and his sad fate, joined to the overbearing
behaviour and rapacity of the invaders, created a revulsion of feeling in the Oahu
chiefs, which culminated in a wide-spread conspiracy against Kahekili and the Maui
chiefs who were distributed over the several districts of Oahu. Kahekili himself and
a number of chiefs were at that time living at Kailua; Manonokauakapekulani, Kaiana,
Namakeha, Nahiolea, Kalaniulumoku, and others, were quartered at Kaneohe and Heeia;
Kalanikupule, Koalaukane, and Kekuamanoha were at Ewa, and Hueu was at Waialua.
</p>
<p>The Oahu leaders of the conspiracy were Elani, the father of Kahahana, Pupuka and
Makaioulu, above referred to, Konamanu, Kalakioonui, and a number of others. The plan
was to kill the Maui chiefs on one and the same night in the different districts.
Elani and his band were to kill the chiefs residing at Ewa; Makaioulu and Pupuka were
to kill Kahekili and the chiefs at Kailua; Konamanu and Kalakioonui were to dispatch
Hueu at Waialua. By some means the conspiracy became known to Kalanikupule, who hastened
to inform his father, Kahekili, and the Maui chiefs at Kaneohe in time to defeat the
object of the conspirators; but, through some cause now unknown, the messenger sent
to advise Hueu, generally known as Kiko-Hueu, failed to arrive in time, and Hueu and
all his retainers then living at Kaowakawaka, in Kawailoa, of the Waialua district,
were killed. The conspiracy was known as the “<i>Waipio Kimopo</i>” (the Waipio assassination), having originated in Waipio, Ewa.
</p>
<p>Fearfully did Kahekili avenge the death of Hueu on the revolted Oahu chiefs. Gathering
his forces together, he overran the districts of Kona and Ewa, and a war of extermination
ensued. Men, women, and children were killed without discrimination and without mercy.
The streams of Makaho and Niuhelewai in Kona, and that of Hoaeae in Ewa, are said
to have been literally choked with the corpses of the slain. The native Oahu aristocracy
were almost entirely extirpated. It is related that one of the Maui chiefs, named
Kalaikoa, caused the bones of the slain to be scraped and cleaned, and that the quantity
collected was so great that he built a house for himself, the walls of which were
laid up entirely of the skeletons of the slain. The skulls of Elani, Konamanu, and
Kalakioonui adorned the portals of this horrible house. The house was called “Kauwalua,”
and was situated at Lapakea in Moanalua, as one passes by the old upper road to Ewa.
The site is still pointed out, but the bones have received burial.
</p>
<p>The rebellion of the Oahu chiefs appears to have had its supporters even among the
chiefs and followers of Kahekili. Kalaniulumoku, the son of Kamehamehanui and nephew
of Kahekili, took the part of the Oahu chiefs, and was supported by Kaiana, <span class="pageNum" id="pb291">[<a href="#pb291">291</a>]</span>Namakeha, Nahiolea, and Kaneoneo,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14918src" href="#xd32e14918">9</a> the grandson of Peleioholani. Their struggle was unsuccessful, and only added to
the long list of the illustrious slain. Kalaniulumoku was driven over the Pali of
Olomana and killed; Kaneoneo was killed at Maunakapu, as one descends to Moanalua;
Kaiana, Nahiolea, and Namakeha escaped to Kauai. A number of chiefesses of the highest
rank—“<i>Kapumoe</i>”—were killed, mutilated, or otherwise severely afflicted. Kekelaokalani, the cousin
of Kahahana’s mother and of Kahekili, made her escape to Kauai. As an instance of
deep affection, of bitterness of feeling, and of supreme hope of return and revenge
at some future day, it is said that she took with her when she fled some of the Oahu
soil from Apuakehau, Kahaloa, Waialua, and Kupalaha at Waikiki, and deposited it at
Hulaia, Kaulana, and Kane, on Kauai (pp. 217–227).

<h2 class="main">On Hawaiian Rank.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some years ago, in the spring and summer of 1883, a sharp and bitter controversy arose
between the two native Hawaiian newspapers, the <i>Kuokoa</i> and the <i>Elele Poakolu</i>, as to the <i>dignus</i> and <i>status</i> of the Hawaiian nobility in olden time and more especially the rank and pretensions
of two families, of which the <i>Kuokoa</i> represented one, and the <i>Elele</i> the other. I noted and made memoranda of the controversy for further use, but as
the legislative committee on the genealogy of the chiefs had been appointed and was
supposed to be actively at work at that time, I looked upon the controversy of the
two newspapers as an intrusion, if not an impertinence, and reserved my own opinion
on the subject in dispute until said committee should have, in a manner authoritatively,
settled and published the rules for determining the ancient degrees of nobility, their
number and their relative status with their kapus or privileges, whether inherent
and inalienable or incidental and changeable.
</p>
<p>At the legislative session of 1884 said committee on the genealogy of the chiefs made
a report which no doubt was very valuable for the information it rendered on many
subjects, but through some unfortunate oversight it did not touch on the genealogy
of the chiefs, and I and the public generally were left in doubt as to the position
that the committee would take touching the rank and privileges of the nobility. The
committee, however, was continued in its labors by the legislature of 1884, and during
these last two years expectation stood on tip-toe among not a few of His Majesty’s
subjects, whose family records tell them that the blue blood of the Kawelos, the Kakuhihewas,
the Kaulaheas, the Kiha-nuis and Keakealanis, is still coursing in their veins as
well as in those of their sovereigns, and whose public recognition as such descendants
depended on the faithful, intelligent and impartial investigation of said genealogy
committee. The legislative session of 1886 has closed, but the committee on the genealogy
of the chiefs, whatever may have occupied its attention during the last two years,
has not spoken on the subject which was especially entrusted to it.
</p>
<p>Unable, therefore, to ascertain from the committee which families, claiming descent
from the ancient <i>noblesse</i>, it would have recognized as entitled to a page on “The Golden Book” of the Hawaiian
<i>alii</i>; and equally uncertain as to the rules, methods or principles the committee might
have adopted in order to decide, first, whether a person was a noble at all, secondly,
what is or would have been his rank and status under the old regime, before nobles
created by the king plus the Constitution filled the seats in the Hawaiian House of
Lords formerly, up to 1845 and 6, occupied by native born Hawaiian chiefs. Unable
to find this out from the committee, I am obliged to fall back upon my own resources,
such as the reading of the ancient legends and chants, and the writings of those Hawaiians
who wrote upon the subject some thirty or forty years ago, before the rising generation
became smitten with the mania of interpolating history and fabricating genealogies
to order.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb308">[<a href="#pb308">308</a>]</span></p>
<p>Under the old regime there certainly were ranks and degrees of nobility, well understood
and scrupulously observed, with their accompanying kapus and privileges. A <i>pio</i> chief, or chiefess, out-ranked a <i>niau-pio</i>, or a <i>naha</i>, but these three classes could claim the <i>kapu-moe</i> (prostration) from the other nobility and from the commoners, and were exempt, I
think, from rendering that observance to each other. The distinction between the three
was social rather than political, and time and circumstances generally determined
how far the etiquette, due from each to each, should be enforced or relaxed.
</p>
<p>To explain the relation of these three classes of the nobility I would say that by
“<i>niau-pio</i>” was understood the very highest cast, not only by descent but also by power, such
as the sovereigns of the islands, the <i>moi</i>, their children—if the mothers were of sufficient rank—and the <i>aimoku</i>, or district chiefs. By <i>pio</i> was understood the children of a brother and sister or half-brother and half-sister,
whose parents were both <i>niau-pio</i>. By <i>naha</i> was understood the children of a father with his daughter, or an uncle with his niece,
both the parents being <i>niau-pio</i>. To illustrate: Keawe-i-kekahi-alii was king of Hawaii and Kalanikauleleiaiwi was
his half-sister, both from the same mother, though with different father. Keawe and
Kalanikaulele cohabited and their children Keeaumoku (k) and Kekela (w) were <i>pio</i> chiefs as well as <i>niau-pio</i>. But Keawe had another wife named Laamaikanaka from the powerful I family in Hilo,
with whom he had a son Kalani-nui-amamao, who was the oldest, who succeeded his father
as <i>moi</i> or sovereign, who was a great <i>niau-pio</i>, but was not a <i>pio</i> like his half-brother Keeaumoku. Kalanikaulele had other husbands, among whom I need
only mention Lonoikahaupu, the king of Kauai, with whom she begat Keawepoepoe, the
ancestor of the present reigning family, who was a <i>niau-pio</i> but was not a <i>pio</i>. And similar examples may be drawn from all the islands.
</p>
<p>Again the same Keawe-i-kekahi-alii with his wife Laamaikanaka had a daughter called
Kaohiokaka. With this daughter Keawe cohabited and she bore a daughter called Kekaulike.
That daughter was a <i>naha</i> chiefess under the old heraldry. This Kekaulike cohabited with her mother’s brother
Kalaninuiamamao and begat a son named Keawemauhili. That son was a <i>naha</i>, as well as his mother and hence he was frequently called Keawe-wili-lua (Keawe-twice-turned).
</p>
<p>These three classes and the rest of the recognized nobility formed what was called
the <i>papa-alii</i> by a general term, or the <i>aha-alii</i>, the convocation of nobles, the “<i>Ritterstand</i>.”
</p>
<p>Below the three classes above named the <i>papa-alii</i> recognized several gradations of nobility; but they were social rather than political
distinctions. Thus a child born of a <i>niau-pio</i> chiefess and a chief not a niau-pio took precedence of a child born to a <i>niau-pio</i> chief with a chiefess not <i>niau-pio</i>. In fact the mother’s rank invariably prevailed over that of the father, with certain
exceptions, as when the father publicly acknowledged and adopted the child as his
own, although the mother’s rank may not have been equal to the father’s.
</p>
<p>The descent from being a <i>niau-pio</i>, a <i>pio</i>, or a <i>naha</i>, to one of the inferior degrees of the <i>aha alii</i> of the nobility, took several generations to accomplish. The writer in the <i>Kuokoa</i> newspaper, to whom I have referred, speaks of <i>wohi, lo alii, alii papa, lokea <span class="pageNum" id="pb309">[<a href="#pb309">309</a>]</span>alii</i>, <i>laauli alii</i>, and <i>kukaepopolo</i>, as distinct grades of nobility, one above the other in the order named. My reading
and acquaintance with the ancient rules of heraldry do not correspond with such a
classification.
</p>
<p>The <i>wohi</i> was a function, an office, not a degree of nobility. It had its peculiar privileges,
among which was the exemption from rendering the <i>kapu-moe</i> to the sovereign, the <i>moi</i>. Its duties were that of a prime minister, and on public occasions the <i>wohi</i> walked in front of the sovereign to see that the ceremonial was duly performed and
that everybody else, who was not exempt, duly observed the <i>kapu-moe</i>. Like many other institutions it tended to become hereditary. Thus the son of a <i>wohi</i> under one sovereign was most likely to become the <i>wohi</i> under the son of that sovereign; but when the dynasty changed the <i>wohi</i>-ship changed also. Thus the <i>wohi</i> of Kumahana, King of Oahu, was no longer the <i>wohi</i> of Kahahana, who succeeded Kumahana as the head of a new dynasty. Thus the <i>wohi</i> of Kalaniopuu, King of Hawaii, was no longer the <i>wohi</i> when Kamehameha I. had obtained the ascendancy. The <i>wohi</i>-ship was peculiarly an institution on the leeward islands, Oahu and Kauai, and was
only comparatively lately introduced on Maui and Hawaii. While the office lasted the
privileges attached to it were exercised and enforced; when the office lapsed, the
privileges ceased, and the late incumbent was simply a <i>naiu-pio</i>, or a chief of less degree, as the case might be. Keawemauhili was the <i>wohi</i> of his nephew <i>Kiwalao</i>, King of Hawaii; Keliimaikai was the <i>wohi</i> of his brother Kamehameha I.; but neither the children of Keliimaikai claimed, or
were awarded the privileges of a <i>wohi</i> after the death of their parents. The precedence that a <i>wohi</i> obtained over other nobles was in virtue of his office alone, and as temporary as
the incumbency of that office. The last Hawaiian <i>wohi</i> was Keliimaikai, the aforesaid brother of Kamehameha I., and his son Kekuaokalani
might have remained <i>wohi</i> under Liholiho, Kamehameha II., had he not rebelled against him.
</p>
<p>The <i>lo</i> was not, as the <i>Kuokoa</i> writer assumes, a specific name for one of the degree of nobility. It was a patronymic,
distinguishing a certain family on Oahu. The first known in Hawaiian legends and history
was Lo Lale, the brother of Piliwale and Kalamakua, sons of Kalonaiki, the Oahu sovereign.
<i>Lo</i> was a title or epithet exclusively belonging to Lale’s descendants. What the occasion
of the title, or what kapus and privileges, if any, it conferred, I have been unable
to ascertain. As a degree of nobility <i>lo</i> was unknown throughout the group. As a title, or sobriquet, it was never assumed
by any one who could not clearly trace his descent from that first <i>Lo Lale</i>, lord of Lihue and adjoining lands in Ewa and Waialua.
</p>
<p>The division of the nobility which the <i>Kuokoa</i> writer designates by the names of <i>alii papa</i> and <i>lokea-alii</i> are unknown to me. They do not occur in the old meles or kaaos, and I know not their
origin. These, as well as the other divisions, which he designates by the names of
<i>laauli alii</i> and <i>kaukau alii</i>, were all recognized nobles, <i>alii</i> of the <i>papa alii</i> or the <i>aha alii</i>; local circumstances and social conventionalities determining generally for the time
being the precedence due from one to the other. Their privileges, prerogatives and
kapus, be they great or small, whether derived from mother or father, were theirs
by birth or inheritance. A chief of the <i>papa alii</i> may not deem it practicable, expedient or prudent to exact those privileges and kapus
at times, but his right to their observance none could deprive him of. During the
frequent wars which <span class="pageNum" id="pb310">[<a href="#pb310">310</a>]</span>harrassed the country in former days a chief may have lost his lands and possessions
and been driven into exile and reduced to poverty and there be no one left to do him
homage, or observe the kapus towards him, or he might never have had land and subjects
assigned him from his infancy. But if fortune smiled upon him and if, through the
strength of his spear or the favor of his sovereign <i>moi</i>, he reconquered the paternal domain or obtained another, he simply resumed the rights
and kapus which had been lying in abeyance during poverty and exile. Some families
never recovered from such a disaster, but their descendants retain to this day their
rank unimpaired and the rights which that rank conferred, though it may not be prudent
or practicable to exact them. To illustrate the vicissitudes of the aristocracy during
the last 150 years: The old nobility of Molokai, the descendants of Maweke of Nuakea,
of Keoloewa, circumscribed in territorial possessions certainly, but as lofty and
as pure in its blue blood as any of Oahu or Kauai were, with the exception of one
family destroyed, despoiled and exiled by Peleioholani of Oahu in vengeance for the
death of his daughter, Kulanihonuaiakama, who was treacherously killed by some chiefs
of windward Molokai. Thus the Oahu chief families, the descendants of Maweke of Laakona,
of the Kalonas[?], went to the wall and were despoiled by Kahekili of Maui, after
his conquest of the island, not one Oahu chief of the ancient nobility remaining in
possession of his hereditary lands. Death, flight and exile were their portion. Thus
the Maui aristocracy, the descendants of Haho, of Eleio, of Piilani, with the exception
of the few who joined the conquering party, were despoiled after the conquest of the
island by Kamehameha I. Thus, though somewhat later in time, the Kauai aristocracy,
the proud descendants of Maweke, of Ahukini-a-Laa, of Manokalanipo, were almost literally
exterminated or reduced during the insurrection of Humehume against Liholiho, Kamehameha
II. As for the Hawaiian noblesse, the descendants of Hikapoloa, of Pilikaeaea, of
Kiha-nui-lulu-moku, how many have survived the internecine wars that followed the
death of Keawe-i-kekahi-alii and the death of Kalaniopuu? Where are the scions of
Imakakaloa of Puna, of Piena of Kau, of Palena of Kohala, and others too numerous
to mention? What would have been the fate of the illustrious and once powerful house
of I of Hilo, the descendants of Liloa and Piilani, had not a lucky accident ranged
Keawe-a-Heulu on the side of three other chiefs, whose spears and whose counsel raised
Kamehameha I. on the throne? As it was, other adverse circumstances afterwards nearly
brought that house to its ruin, when another turn of fortune’s wheel placed it on
the top of the ladder. But who will venture to say that during this partial eclipse
for more than two generations, when for prudential reasons its white <i>puloulou</i>, or its day-light torches were no longer visible, its kapus, its rights, its privileges,
or its rank had been forfeited, diminished, or lost through non-observance? Who will
dispute the rank and the kapus of Keawemauhili’s descendants through Elelule and Kuhio,
backed as they were by the royal escutcheon of Kamakahelei of Kauai? And yet the heirs
to that rank were ignored and their kapus slumbered for more than fifty years, until
of late their former status has been restored. Who will deny the rank and heraldic
consideration due to the descendants of the great house of Kualii of Oahu, either
through his son Peleioholani or his daughter Kukuiaimakalani, many if not most of
whom, have not at present land enough of their own to be buried in, and whose only
remaining heirlooms <span class="pageNum" id="pb311">[<a href="#pb311">311</a>]</span>are the consciousness of their rank and their family chants, their <i>mele inoa</i> which at one time were solicited, but solicited in vain, by even so proud a king
as Lot Kamehameha V.
</p>
<p>There was an expression used in olden times to designate certain chiefs, male or female,
which expression in those days did not mark a fixed or certain degree of nobility,
but was a relative term of a large degree of elasticity. That term was <i>kaukau-alii</i>. In later and modern times the term has been made to imply inferiority and dependence.
To illustrate: In olden time the children of Hakau-a-Liloa looked upon the children
of Umi-a-Liloa, their cousins, as <i>kaukau alii</i> compared to themselves, though the sovereignty of Hawaii and the highest political
kapus rested with the latter. Thus the children of Kalaninuiamamao and of Keeaumoku
of Hawaii looked upon the children of Kumukoa and of Awili, their cousins, as <i>kaukau-alii</i> compared with themselves. Thus Kalaipaihala, the son of Kalaniopuu of Hawaii, was
a <i>kaukau-alii</i> to his brother Kiwalao, although he was a <i>niau-pio</i> chief in his own right. The term was relative and did not mark a degree of nobility.

<h2 class="main">Chronological List.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Every people, possessed of some culture or civilization, attempts to preserve a record
of its past, whether that record is handed down orally, or by some sort of writing.
With the Hawaiians as with their Polynesian congeners everywhere, such records were
passed down orally from father to child, or from master to disciple, within the professional
circle of those to whom immemorial usage has consigned the preservation of them. But
history, or a record of the past, would become unintelligible and rank confusion unless
set forth or arranged upon some system of chronology. Some peoples counted time by
the number of generations from some common ancestor; some counted by the length of
reign of each successive king or chief; some counted each individual year within a,
by them, generally adopted era. The Hawaiians counted by generations of their principal
chiefs or kings. They started from Wakea as a common ancestor of all the chiefs on
all the islands of the Hawaiian group; but, for convenience or clearness sake, time
was counted by either of the reigning families on the four principal islands: Kauai,
Oahu, Maui, or Hawaii. Thus an event, worthy of being preserved on the national records,
was said to have occurred “in the time of”—“<i lang="haw">i ke au o</i>”—such or such a prominent chief of this or that island; and, in order to ascertain
when, the generations were counted either down from Wakea, or more generally up (back)
from the then present generation. Thus Hawaiian chronology was not very exact, it
must be admitted; but to a people, who depended entirely upon the faithful memory
of their bards and priests, it was sufficiently approximate to bring order and sequence
in their unwritten records of the past. To us, of a later and more developed civilization,
the exactitude of dates is of the very essence of history, or at least one of its
most necessary elements; but an approximation to truth satisfied the ancient Hawaiian.
</p>
<p>In my work, “The Polynesian Race, its Origin and Migrations,” Vol. I, p. 166, I have
approximately fixed the period of Wakea at about 190 A.D., and the length of a generation,
for the purposes of historical computation, at 30 years. Counting 13 generations after
Wakea we arrive at Nanaulu, in whose time the Hawaiian group was undoubtedly occupied
by the Hawaiian branch of the Polynesian Race, say 580 A.D. Continuing on the genealogical
line of Nanaulu, as the safest and most correct, we arrive after 15 more generations,
or 450 years, at the period of Maweke, say 1030 A.D., when that remarkable intermigratory
movement between the southern and northern Polynesian groups, of which their legends
and chants give so ample evidence, had already commenced. From Maweke down, therefore,
Hawaiian chronology may be computed from any of the leading genealogies, counting
Maweke as No. 29, Paumakua as No. 30, Pilikaeaea as No. 31 from Wakea.
</p>
<p>Thus, to take only two genealogies out of many, we get the following approximate,
chronological lists, viz:

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Wahine-o-Lalohana, connected with Kaiakahinalii. Lalohana, a country “<i lang="haw">maloko o ke kai</i>” (in the sea). Another story says that she lived at Mauna, a coral reef <i>makai</i> (seaward) of Keauhou, Kona, and that Lono was the <i>mauka</i> (inland) chief.
</p>
<p>Another story says the woman lived at Waiakea, Hilo, and the chief was Konikonia.
Konikonia’s people went out fishing on the coral reef and their hooks were broken
off by the Wahine-o-Lalohana. Her <i>kaikunane</i>, Kuula, was below the water and sometimes lived with Konikonia. This Kuula told Konikonia’s
people that there were other people, men and women, living under the water (“<i>he kulanakauhale</i>”), a village, and they had broken the hooks. Kuula, being interrogated by Konikonia
as to whether he belonged to that people, said he did and that he had a sister there,
whereupon Konikonia told him to fetch her to be his wife. Kuula informed Konikonia
of the process how to catch his sister by making images of her husband, Kiimaluhaku,
and letting them down in the water, when she would think that he had returned from
Kukulu o Kahiki, whither he had gone on a journey. The ruse succeeded and she was
led to follow the string of images from below to the canoe and thence to Konikonia’s
house, where she fell asleep, and woke up in the afternoon, finding Konikonia with
her. She then sent for her food from below. In bringing her coconut shell up the contents
were spilled, proved to be the <i>mahina</i> (moon), and flew up to heaven.
</p>
<p>Four days she stayed ashore when she wanted to see her parents. Being asked who they
were, she said Kahinalii was her father and Hinakaalualumoana was her mother. Being
further asked if they would come ashore after her, she said no, not bodily, but that
the waters which were then rising had come to search for her, and they would overwhelm
every inch of ground, and that her brothers were running ahead of the sea. Then Konikonia
and she ran for the mountain and climbed up the tall trees and built a place to stay
in. They stayed there ten days, during which time Kahinalii covered the whole earth
with the sea and all the people perished; but when it had reached Konikonia’s place
it subsided, and he and she and all his <i>ohua</i> (household) were saved, and they returned to <i>terra firma</i>. David Malo thinks it an imported tale though older by far than the arrival of the
<i>haole</i> (foreigners) with Captain Cook.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Lihaula was the elder brother of Wakea. They fought and Lihaula was conquered. Afterward
Wakea fought with Kaneiakumuhonua and was beaten and driven out of the land and took
to the sea. Some say this took place on Hawaii and Wakea was pursued to Kaula when
he fled over the sea. Others say they fought in Hikiku and Wakea fled over the sea.
Komoawa was the <i>kahuna</i> (priest) of Wakea. Afterwards <span class="pageNum" id="pb319">[<a href="#pb319">319</a>]</span>Wakea fought Kaneiakumuhonua and beat him and retained the <i>Aupuni</i> (Government). Popokolonuha was Komoawa’s wife, and some say that Hoohokukalani was
their daughter and not Wakea’s.—Wakea’s first son was Haloanaka, who died and grew
up as taro. He (Wakea) afterwards begat Haloa.

<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Kanipahu lived in Kalae, Molokai, because Kamaiole had brought Hawaii under his sway.
Kanipahu was not aware of his being the rightful alii of Hawaii. He had two children
on Hawaii, Kalapana and Kalahumoku. Kamaiole did not know that they were Kanipahu’s
children or he would have killed them. The Hawaiians were disgusted with Kamaiole’s
oppression and went to Paao (who it seems was still alive) for advice and aid. Paao
sent messengers to Molokai, to Kanipahu, to tell him to come back to Hawaii. Kanipahu
refused, being ashamed of the lump on his shoulders, but told the messengers to go
to Waimanu, Hamakua, and they would find his son Kalapana whom they should enthrone
as king. Paao sent for Kalapana, and Kamaiole was killed at Anaehoomalu in Kekaha,
on his way to Kona.
</p>
<p>Paao is said to have lived 680 years (“<i lang="haw">he lau me na kanaha ehiku</i>”), in the time <span class="pageNum" id="pb320">[<a href="#pb320">320</a>]</span>of Laaualii, and he died in the time of Kamakaohua. Kau-a-Kamakaohua, daughter of
Kamakaohua, was the wife of Hoalani, and their daughter was Ipuwai-a-Hoalani, the
wife of Kaihikapu-a-Kakuihewa. From Laaualii to Kaniakaohua there were fifteen generations.
</p>
<p>Paao’s son was Kahuakanani. Paao seems to have been a family name applicable to the
descendants of the first Paao. The name as borne by that family of kahunas occurs
during several generations.
</p>
<p>Paao came in the time of Lonokawai who was after Kapawa; the 26th generation of chiefs.
Pili afterwards was brought over to Hawaii from Tahiti by Paao in the vessel called
Kanaloanui. The fish <i>opelu</i> and <i>aku</i> came with Pili, hence they were kapued fish. (<i>Hoku Pakipika</i>, Feb. 13, 1862.)
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Kalaunuiohua. In his time lived Waahia, a noted prophetess (<i>kaula</i>).
</p>
<p>Kamaluohua was king of Maui and fought with Kalau and was beaten. Kalau then fought
with Kahokuohua, chief of Molokai, and beat him too. Kalau then fought with Huapouleilei
of Oahu. Kalau then fought with Kukona of Kauai, was beaten, taken prisoner and afterward
released.

<p>Kauholanuimahu went to Honuaula, Maui, to reside, and while there he built the <i>loko</i> (fish-pond) at Keoneoio. While he was living on Maui his wife remained on Hawaii
and took another husband who revolted against Kauhola, who returned to Hawaii, beat
his opponent and retook the government.

<p>Names of lands and islands known to the ancient Hawaiians, and mentioned in the <i>mele</i>, <i>kaao</i>, <i>pule or moolelo</i>: Kahiki was the general name for all foreign lands outside of Hawaii nei; lands or
places said to have been visited by Kaulu, or Ulu, the brother of Nanaulu, children
of Kii in the genealogy of Welaahilaninui (although in the mele of Kaulu, in which
these places recur, Kaulu calls himself the “Kama a Kalana”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20629src" href="#xd32e20629">2</a>) are as follows: Wawau, Upolu (Upolo), Pukalia-iki, Pukalia-nui, Alala, Pelua, Palana,
Holani, Kuina, Ulunui, Uliuli, Melemele, Hii-kua, Hii-alo, Hakalauai-apo, Kukulu-o-Kahiki,
Moanawaikaioo (maelstrom); Kapakapakaua and Ulupaupau were places in Kahiki visited
by Hema and by Kahai-a-Hema, nephew of Puna-imua; Kahiki-ku and Kahiki-moe were visited
by Kila, Moikeha’s son. Thence came Laa, or Laa-mai-kahiki, his brother.
</p>
<p>Tahiti lands, from which Olopana came when he settled on Oahu and married Hina, and
built the Heiau of Kawa’ewa’e in Kaneohe, include the following: Keolewa; Haenakulaina;
Kauaniani; Kalakeenuiakane; Nuumehelani; Kuaihelani; Kapaahu, the place of Kapuheeuanui
who fished the islands out of the sea; Moaulanuiakea, Nuuhiwa and Polapola, known
in the tale of Moikeha—see the mele of Kamahualele; Keapapanuu and Keapapa-lani, in

</p>
<p>Kauhiakama, the son of Kamalalawalu was carried prisoner from Maui by the Oahu chiefs
and burnt at Apuakehau, in Waikiki, and his skull was used as an <i>ipu honowa</i> (excrement receptacle), hence the vindictiveness of Kahekili to the Oahu chiefs.
</p>
<p>Keelanihonuaiakama was the daughter of Peleioholani and was killed by the Molokai
chiefs, hence Peleioholani’s wars and vindictiveness toward them.
</p>
<p>Peleioholani was son of Kualii, king of Oahu. He conquered Molokai in the time of
Keawa, and put his son Kumahana as king of Maui, say 1764.
</p>
<p>Kapiiohokalani was a brother of Peleioholani; Kaneoneo was the son of Kumahana.
</p>
<p>Kumahana, son of Peleioholani, followed him as king of Oahu, about 1770, and three
years afterward he was dethroned (<i>wailana-ia</i>), when Kahahana was sent for from Maui and became king of Oahu.
</p>
<p>Keeaumoku rebelled against Kalaniopuu in Hawaii and went over to Maui, about 1765.
In 1767 he rebelled against Kahekili and was defeated at Waihee, afterwards off Molokai
whither Kahekili had pursued him, and he fled to Hana where Kaahumanu was born to
him and his wife, Namahana, about 1768. Mahihelelima was then chief of Hana.
</p>
<p>Hoapilikane, the son of Kameeiamoku and his wife Kealiiokahekili was born about 1776.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb322">[<a href="#pb322">322</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hoapiliwahine, daughter of Keeaumoku and Namahana, and younger sister to Kaahumanu,
was born about 1778.
</p>
<p>Kekuaokalani, or Kepookalani Kalaninuimalokuloku, popularly known as Keliimaikai,
called a younger brother of Kamehameha I.; it was he who fought for the maintenance
of the kapu under Liholiho I. His wife was Manono.
</p>
<p>Kamehameha’s wives, <i>hooipo</i>, were Peleuli, Keopuolani, Kai and Kaahumanu; his <i>wahine hoao</i> was Kaheiheimalie, daughter of Keeaumoku, born about 1778. His children were Kamehamalu,
Kahoanoku. He had another wife Kahoa (?) another called Kaneikapolei and Kalola.
</p>
<p>Kekela (who died last year) [about 1870] was the daughter of Kalaniwahikapaa, the
granddaughter of Kanealai; she was <i>hoomoeia</i> (espoused) by Kamehameha to Kamaholelani, a Kauai chief.
</p>
<p>Manono, wife of Kekuaokalani, was Kekuanaoa’s sister.
</p>
<p>Manono’s mother was Luahiwa. Kaukuahi was Manono’s child.
</p>
<p>Manonokauakapekulani was elder brother of Kekuanaoa; they were grandchildren of Kanealai.
</p>
<p>P. Kanoa is from Molokai, a grandson of Peekua who descended from Kanealai on the
side of Pailili. Also C. Kanaina. Their grandmother was Kaha.
</p>
<p>Kanealai was Keawe’s wife; they had four children: Hao, Awili, Kaililoamoku and Kumukoa.
Kanealai was connected with Kahekili. So was Pehu. Kalaniwahiikapaa’s wife was Mulehu.
Kawao’s wife was Kalanihelemailuna; their child was A. Paki. Kumukoa’s wife was Kaulahoa.
Kumukoa’s child was Kalaikuahulu, who was connected on Molokai somehow.
</p>
<p>Six chiefs of Hawaii, whose bones were in the basket of Lonoikamakahiki and exhibited
before Kakuhihewa of Oahu, are called <i>kaikaina</i> of Keawe-nui-a-Umi. (See Kaao of Lono.) Their names are as follows:

<p>“The ends of the earth and of heaven were created (<i>hanau ia</i>) by Kumukanikekaa (w) and her husband Paialani.
</p>
<p>“Others say that Kamaieli (w) whose other name was Haloihoilalo, begat the foundation
of the earth, and that Kumuhonua was her husband.
</p>
<p>“In the mookuauhau of <i>Kumulipo</i> it is said that the earth and the heaven grew up of themselves (<i>ulu wale</i>).
</p>
<p>“In the mookuauhau of <i>Wakea</i> it is said that his wife <i>Papa</i> begat a calabash (<i>ipu</i>)—the bowl and the cover—Wakea threw the cover upward and it became the heaven; from
the inside meat and seeds Wakea made the sun, moon, stars and sky; from the juice
he made the land and the sea.
</p>
<p>“In the <i>moolelo</i> of <i>Moi</i>, the prophet of Keoloewa-a-kamau, of Molokai; in the prophecies and sayings of Nuakea,
the prophetess of Luhaukapawa, Kapewaiku, Kapewalani, <span class="pageNum" id="pb323">[<a href="#pb323">323</a>]</span>of Kauai; of Maihea and Naulu-a-Maihea, the prophet race of Oahu in the time of Lonohoonewa
(the father of Paumakua); of Luahoomoe, the prophet of Hua of Maui—in all these prophecies—it
is said that the gods (<i>na akua</i>) created heaven and earth. The gods who created heaven and earth were three, Kane,
Ku, and Lono. Kanaloa was the great enemy of these three gods. Before this creation
of heaven, earth, etc., everything was shaky, trembling and destitute, bare, (<i>naka</i>, <i>olohelohe</i>); nothing could be distinguished, everything was tossing about, and the spirits of
the gods were fixed to no bodies, only the three above gods had power to create heaven
and earth. Of these three Kane was the greatest in power, and Ku and Lono were inferior
to him. The powers of the three joined together were sufficient to create and fix
heaven and earth.
</p>
<p>“Their creation commenced on the 26th day of the month, on the day called Kane and
was continued during the days called Lono, Mauli, Muku, Hilo and Hoaka.
</p>
<p>“In six days the creation was done and the seventh day, the day called <i>Ku</i>, became the first kapu day (<i>la kapu</i>), day of rest. The first and the last of the seven days in every month have been
kept <i>kapu</i> ever since by all generations of Hawaiians.” (Mookuauhau o Puanue. <i>Au Okoa</i> Oct. 14, 1869.)
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>In an ancient prayer reference is made to the subversion of the creed of religion
(kapu) of Kahai by Lono.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>When Moikeha came from Tahiti (Moaulanui) he brought with him his <i>kilokilo</i>, called Kamahualele, who followed him to Kauai; also his two sisters, named Makapuu
and Makaaoa; also his two brothers named Kumukahi and Haehae; also his <i>kahuna</i> named Mookini. When he arrived at Hilo in Hawaii, Kumukahi and Haehae wished to stop
there and they were put ashore. (Is Lae Kumukahi called after the first and Haehae
after the other?—probably.) When Moikeha got off at Kohala, Mookini and Kaluawilinau
left there. (Is the old heiau of Mookini called after Moikeha’s <i>kahuna</i>?—probably.) At Hana another follower named Honuaula was left. At Oahu his two sisters
Makapuu and Makaaoa were left, hence probably “Lae Makapuu,” East Cape of Oahu. Kamahualele
was an adopted son of Moikeha.—He traveled in a double canoe (<i>kaulua</i>). Moikeha was a red-haired, florid man (<i>ehu kumuuli</i>).
</p>
<p>In the Hawaiian priesthood, (<i>oihana kahuna</i>) there were ten branches or colleges. He who was master of, or proficient, in all
was called a high priest (<i>kahuna nui</i>.) The names of these branches of learning, or colleges were: (1) <i>Anaana</i>, (2) <i>Hoopiopio</i>, (3) <i>Hoounauna</i>—these three connected with the practice of sorcery, by prayer and signs, for the
death or injury of another. (4) <i>Hookomokomo</i>, (5) <i>Po’i-uhane</i>, connected with divination by causing spirits of the dead to enter the body of a
subject and possess it. (6) <i>Lapaau maoli</i>, medicine generally. (7) <i>Kuhikuhi-puu-one</i>, consulted about building temples, their location and prosperity. (8) <i>Oneoneihonua</i>, (9) <i>Kilokilo</i>, (10) <i>Nanauli</i>, soothsayers, diviners, prophets.
</p>
<p>Each one of these ten was again subdivided in classes and occupations of detail. The
priesthood was governed by rules and regulations of its own, stringent oaths were
exacted before admission and heavy penalties upon infraction.
</p>
<p>A number of gods were invoked by the different classes and subdivisions of the priesthood,
but the principal god, who seems to have been the presiding and tutelar deity of the
entire body of priests was called <i>Uli</i>, the blue sky, the vault of heaven.

<p class="first">From Wakea and Papa down to the period of Maweke and his contemporaries there is considerable
difference in the current Hawaiian genealogies. I will now give as many of these different
versions as have come to my knowledge, commencing with the most generally received,
and the one that was adopted by David Malo in that earliest attempt at a written history
of the Hawaiian islands, prepared at Lahainaluna in 1836 while yet a great number
of the chiefs and priests from the heathen times were alive. It runs exclusively on
the Ulu-Hema-Hanalaa-nui line of the Hawaiian chiefs, ignoring the Nanaulu, Puna and
Hanalaa-iki branches. I will insert them however entire,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20835src" href="#xd32e20835">1</a> because the comments and critical comparisons which I have to make may oblige me
to refer to names subsequent to the Maweke-Paumakua period; and to avoid inconvenience
in future references, it will be better to have the whole of such genealogy at one
place, than to have them as scattered fractions in many places.

<h2 class="main">Notes on the Polynesian Calendar.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Polynesians divided the years into seasons, months and days. The seasons, or <i>kau</i>, of the year were generally two: the rainy or winter season, and the dry or summer
season, varying according to the particular situation of the group, either north or
south of the equator. The commencement of the seasons, however, were regulated by
the rising of the Pleiades, or <i>Makalii</i>, at the setting of the sun. Thus in the Society group the year was divided in <i>Makarii-i-ria</i>,—Pleiades above the horizon,—and <i>Makarii-i-raro</i>, Pleiades below: the first from November to May, the latter from May to November.
In the Hawaiian group the year was divided into two seasons, <i>hooilo</i>, the rainy season, from about the 20th of November to 20th of May, and <i>kau</i>, the dry season from 20th May to 20th November. In the Samoan, <i>tau</i> or <i>tausanga</i> meant originally a period of six months, and afterwards was employed to express the
full year of twelve months as in the Tonga group. There are traces, also, on the Society
group of the year having been divided into three seasons or <i>tau</i>, like the Egyptians, Arabs and Greeks, though the arrangement of the months within
each season seems to me to have been arbitrary and probably local.
</p>
<p>In regard to the divisions of the year by months, the Polynesians counted by twelve
and thirteen months, the former obtaining in the Tonga, Samoan and Hawaiian groups,
the latter in the Marquesan and Society groups. Each month consisted of thirty days.
It is known that the Hawaiians, who counted twelve months of thirty days each, intercalated
five days at the end of the month Welehu, about the 20th December, which were tabu
days, dedicated to the festival of Lono, after which the new year began with the first
day of the month Makalii, which day was properly called Maka-hiki (equivalent to “commencement”)
and afterwards became the conventional term for a year in the Hawaiian, Marquesan
and Society groups. There is evidence that the Marquesans at one time counted the
year by the lunar months and called it a <i>puni</i>, a circle, a round, a revolution, but how they managed either this or the year of
thirteen months to correspond with the divisions by seasons or the solar year I am
not informed, Tah. <i>Teeri</i> sometimes dropped.
</p>
<p>That a computation by lunar months preceded the other is evident from the various
names of different days in the month, but both computations were evidently far older
than the arrival of the Polynesians in the Pacific.
</p>
<p>To this may be added that the Polynesians counted time also by the nights—<i>po</i>. Tomorrow was <i>a-po-po</i> (Haw.) lit. the night’s night. Yesterday was <i>po-i-nehi-nei</i>, the past night. <i>Po-akahi</i>, <i>po-alua</i>, etc., the first, the second day. <i>Po</i> was the generic term for day and <i>ao</i> or daylight was but the complement of the full <i>po</i>. <i>Po-a-ao</i>, night and day, etc. This method of reckoning by nights ascends to the hoariest antiquity.
The unbroken Aryans counted by nights, and the custom prevailed late into historic
times among the Hindus, the Iranians, the Greeks, the Saxons, and the Scandinavians.
(Pictet v. 2, p. 588.) The Babylonians believed that the world had been created at
the autumnal equinox.—(Lenormant, I, p. 451.)

<p>Another computation commenced the year at the month Apaapa (middle of May) and gave
different names to several of the months. The year was also divided into two seasons
called by the “<i>Matarii</i>” stars (Pleiades)—<i>Matarii i ria</i> (Pleiades above the horizon in the evening) and <i>Matarii i raro</i> (Pleiades below). The year was divided also into three seasons: (1) <i>te tau</i>—autumn, commenced with te Tae or December till Faaahu; (2) <i>te tau miti vahi</i>, season of high sea; (3) <i>te tau poai</i>, winter or season of drought.
</p>
<p>The Hawaiian year was again subdivided into four smaller seasons or divisions: (1)
<i lang="haw">ke laa-make</i>, (2) <i lang="haw">ka hooilo</i>, (3) <i lang="haw">ka laa-ulu</i>, (4) <i lang="haw">kau</i>.
</p>
<p>Summer (<span lang="haw">kau</span>) began when the sun stood directly over an island. The winter (<span lang="haw">hooilo</span>) began when the sun moved from there southward.
</p>
<p>Where the ocean and sky meet, the Hawaiians designated as <i lang="haw">Hiki-ku</i>; above <i lang="haw">Kahiki</i>, <i lang="haw">Papanuu</i>; above <i lang="haw">Papanuu</i>, <i lang="haw">Papalani</i>; directly above <i lang="haw">Kahiki</i>, <i lang="haw">Kapuiholanikekuina</i>.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Hawaiian day commenced at 12 midnight and ran till next midnight. There being
only twelve months in the Hawaiian year of 30 days each, or in all 360 days, five
days were added at the end of the month Welehu so that the civil or solar year began
on the 6th day of the month Makalii. The feast of Lono was celebrated during the five
intercalary days. For eight months of the year there were four kapu nights and days
(<i lang="haw">Ku</i>, <i lang="haw">Hua</i>, <i lang="haw">Kaloa</i>, <i lang="haw">Kane</i>) in each month. The four kapu times of the month were also called <i lang="haw">Na la kapu Kauila</i>.
</p>
<p>The Hawaiian division of the night was: 1. Kihi, 6 p.m.; 2. Pili, 9 p.m.; 3. Kau,
12 m.n.; 4. Pilipuka, 3 a.m.; 5. Kihipuka, 6 a.m.
</p>
<p>The Javanese, borrowing from the Hindus, divided the entire twenty-four hours into
five portions, each of which had a particular name. Another division was into nine
parts, four for the day and five for the night.—(Rienzi.)

</p>
<p>The week of seven days was introduced into Java by the Hindus. Previously the week
was divided into five days, like that of the Mexicans. Their names were: (1) <i>laggi</i>, blue, or east; (2) <i>pahina</i>, red, or south; (3) <i>pon</i>, yellow, or west; (4) <i>wagi</i>, black or north; (5) <i>kliwon</i>, mixed colour, the hearth or center. The designating of the north by the black color
indicates, according to Mr. Rienzi, that this denomination originated in Hindustan
where the sun is never to northward, as in Java or other equinoxial countries.
</p>
<p>The ancient Javanese divided the year into thirty periods called <i>woukou</i>, or 360 days, and also into twelve months of unequal length, and the year ended with
intercalary days.
</p>
<p>At Bali, the year commences about the month of April. The Braminical civil year was
the lunar—that of <i>Saka</i> or <i>Salivana</i>—and the priests calculated the intercalary days.
</p>
<p>The Javanese have a cycle of seven years, similar to that of Tibet and Siam. The names
of the years are mostly of Sanscrit origin and are: 1. <i lang="jv">manghara</i>, the lobster or crab; 2. <i lang="jv">menda</i>, the goat; 3. <i lang="jv">kalabang</i>, the centipede; 4. <i lang="jv">wichitra</i>, the worm; 5. <i lang="jv">mintouna</i>, the fish; 6. <i lang="jv">was</i>, the scorpion; 7. <i lang="jv">maicha</i>, the buffalo.
</p>
<p>In speaking of the Javanese cycle of twelve years and the correspondence of the names
of the years with the names of the Sanscrit zodiac, Mr. Rienzi adds: “<span lang="fr">Ainsi nous retrouvons en Océanie le zodiaque de l’Asie centrale que l’Europe a également
adopté</span>”—(<span lang="fr">Océanie</span>, Vol. I, p. 168.)
</p>
<p>In ancient Egypt and Arabia the year was divided into three seasons. This was the
ancient arrangement in the Society islands. The Egyptian year began with the winter
season in or about November, so also in Arabia. The first was the season of sowing
and planting; the second was the summer harvesting and reaping; the third the season
of waters, time of inundating the Nile.—(Glidden’s Ancient Egypt.)

<h2 class="main">Creation Myths.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">According to the legend of Kumuhonua the creation of the world and of man proceeded
in this wise. In the beginning there were four ages or “<i>po</i>.” First: <i>po-loa</i>. Second: <i>po-nui-au-wa-ea</i>. Third: <i>po-kanaka</i>. Fourth: <i>po-hana</i>.
</p>
<p>1. During the po-loa there was neither heaven nor earth; there was simply a deep,
immeasurable darkness, in which dwelt the god Kane, called “Kane-i-ka-po-loa.” He
was a spirit (<i>uhane</i>) without a body.
</p>
<p>2. During the <i>po-nui-au-wa-ea</i> or <i>po-nui-aea</i>, the world and man were created by Kane, Ku, and Lono. Light was first made, and
when it appeared the world (<i>honua</i>) was seen floating about in the darkness; then all other things were created, and
lastly man.
</p>
<p>3. During the <i>po-kanaka</i> man was created. <i>Kumuhonua</i> was the first man. He was made from the settlings of muddy water (<i>Koana wai lepo</i>), in the manner of steam rising from the water (<i>puholoholoia</i>). He was also called Honua-ula or the red earth. Afterwards Kane created the woman
who was called Lalo-honua. She was made from the side of Kumuhonua. <i>Lalo</i> is an ancient name in Hawaiian for the ribs (<i>iwiaoao</i>).
</p>
<p>4. The <i>po-hana</i> is divided in two parts: the po-hana and the po-auhulihia.
</p>
<p>The <i>po-hana</i> reaches from the creation of Kumuhonua to the time of Nuu. At first Kane lived with
Kumuhonua on earth; then Kane gave him laws and instructions and went up to heaven
to reside, and Kumuhonua and Lalo-honua remained on earth. Kumuhonua was now called
Kane-laau-uli. He broke the law of Kane. The law referred to a <i>laau kapu</i> (forbidden tree), and <i>uli</i> (feebleness, death,) was the punishment.
</p>
<p>The <i>po-auhulihia</i>, so called because the earth and all on it was destroyed by the flood (<i>kai-a-kahinalii</i>). Nuu built a big canoe called Waa-halau-alii-o-ka-moku.
</p>
<p>The gods (Kane, Ku, and Lono), seeing the man without a wife, descended on earth,
put him into a sleep, took out one of his ribs (<i>lalo-puhaka</i>) and made it into a woman. They then awoke the man who found the woman on his right
side, and she was called Ke-Ola-Ku-Honua.
</p>
<p>The Hawaiian Legend of Welaahilani is substantially the same, but the first woman’s
name is Owe.
</p>
<p>A Tahitian legend also refers to the creation of the first woman from a rib of the
first man, and calls her Owa, or Owe.
</p>
<p>In the Mele of Kamapuaa reference is made to Ku, Kane, Kanaloa, as the gods of the
night and of the day.
</p>
<p>Kamapuaa is also called “<i>ka haole nui, maka<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24279src" href="#xd32e24279">1</a> olohilohi</i>,” and is said to have eight legs and eight eyes.
</p>
<p>The legend of Pele and Kamapuaa represents some confused and half forgotten <span class="pageNum" id="pb336">[<a href="#pb336">336</a>]</span>conception or knowledge of the contest between religious sects, the followers of Pele
being worshipers and Kamapuaa, a believer in the efficacy of water.
</p>
<p>The people of Pulo-Nias, to the west of Sumatra, believe in a Supreme God called Lora-Langi.
He is not worshiped. Below him is a god called Batu Da Danaw who has charge of the
earth. The world contains several stages. The one immediately below us is occupied
by dwarfs. The heavens or sky above us (<i>holi yawa</i>) are peopled by a superior order of men called <i>barucki</i>, who are gifted with wings and have the power to become invisible at pleasure. They
are governed by kings of their own. The people of the earth continued in a savage
state until the wife of one king (the present) of the barucki (Leo Mepuhana) had pity
on them and taught arts and civilization; then also they were taught to speak. The
language, habits and institutions of the Pulo-Nias are strikingly different from the
other Malay and Asiatic Islanders. Hindustan and Islamism have left no trace here.

<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Rangi and Papa originated all things, but “<i>Po</i>,” of which there was a succession, enveloped everything.
</p>
<p>There was no separation or interval between Rangi and Papa. The children of Rangi
and Papa were: Tumatauenga (father of man); Tane-mahuta (father of forests, etc.);
Tawhiri-ma-tea (father of winds, etc.); Rongo-ma-tane (father of cultivated food);
Tangaroa (father of fish and reptiles); Haumia-tikitiki (father of wild grown food).
</p>
<p>It was Tane-mahuta who rent Rangi and Papa asunder and let in light on the earth.
One of Papa’s names after that was Papa-tu-a-nuku. Tawhiri-ma-tea did not approve
of the separation and followed his father Rangi to the skies and there begat and named
his offspring, the winds.
</p>
<p>Tangaroa begat Panga, and he begat Ika-tere (father of fish) and Tu-ti-wehiwehi or
Tu-ti-wanawana (father of reptiles).
</p>
<p>Tu-matauenga subdued all his brothers except Tawhiri-ma-tea, and then assumed the
different names of Tu-kariri, Tu-ka-nguha, Tu-ka-taua, Tu-whaka-heke-tangata, Tu-mata-wehe-iti.
</p>
<p>Among the children of Rangi and Papa, Tu-matauenga bore the likeness of man, so did
his brothers, so did Po, a Ao, a Kore, ti Kimihanga, and Runuku, and thus they continued
until the time of Ngainui and of Whirote-kupua and of Tiki-tawhito-ariki and their
generations till the present time.
</p>
<p>Many generations after Tu-matauenga lived Taranga (w.) and Makeatu-kara (k.), who
were the parents of Maui-taha, Maui-roto, Maui-pae, Maui-waho and of Maui-tikitiki-a-Taranga.
In their time Death first had power over earth because Maui-a-Taranga tried to deceive
the goddess and ancestress Hina-nui-ti-po (goddess of death).
</p>
<p>Maui caught the sun in a noose, beat him and compelled him ever after to travel slower
and with a lesser heat. He fished up a great portion of the submerged land, and his
fish-hook, made from the jaw-bone of his ancestress Muri-ranga-whenua, is still shown
in the district of Heretaunga in New Zealand, transformed into the south end of Hawke’s
Bay. He got fire from his ancestress Mahu-ika, who pulled out her nails and <span class="pageNum" id="pb337">[<a href="#pb337">337</a>]</span>fire followed. Maui had a sister Hina-uri, whose husband, Irawaru, was changed into
a dog by Maui. From Irawaru sprang all dogs. Maui and his descendants lived in Hawaiki,
until some of them left there and went to Aotea-roa (New Zealand). (Sir Geo. Grey’s
Pol. Mythol.)
</p>
<p>According to Moerenhout (<span lang="fr">Voyage aux Iles du Grand Ocean</span>, I, 446), Rii (a secondary god) separated Heaven and Earth by stretching out the
former like a curtain. Mahui “brought the earth up from the depths of the ocean, and
when mankind suffered from the prolonged absence of the sun and had lived mournfully
in deep obscurity, and when fruits would not ripen, he stopped the sun and regulated
its course so as to make day and night equal.” (Does not that legend indicate that
Polynesians formerly lived in a zone where the inequality of day and night was greater
than in the tropics?). Ru (god of winds), caused the ocean to swell over and break
up the continent into its present island condition. Moerenhout says further (Op. Cit.
p. 568): “<span lang="fr">On ne trouve, nulle part, de vestiges des deux principes, ni de ces combats entre
les ténèbres et la lumiere, la vie et la mort.</span>” Compare, however, the Marquesan cosmogony. He says also (Op. Cit. p. 571) that Polynesian
legends represent the ocean as overflowing its bed and rising up to the highest mountains
“<span lang="fr">sans que, nulle part, il soit question des eaux pluviales.</span>” See, however, the mele of the Deluge in Hawaiian and Marquesan.
</p>
<p>The frequent reference in Polynesian legends to <i>moo</i>, enormous, powerful and magical lizards or serpents, relates to a previous residence
in some country where such reptiles exist, for in Polynesia these are of the smallest
kind. It is more likely to be a remembrance of the serpent worship which obtained
in the Hamitic-Arabic race and was by them spread over India and the archipelago.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Manua was another Hawaiian name for the god or chief of the infernal regions, called
“Po-pau-ole,” “Po-ia-Milu,” “Po-kini-kini,” “Po-kuakini,” “Po-lua-ahi,” “Po-papaia-owa.”
Manua is said to have been the original lord of this place. Milu was only a wicked
chief, whose spirit was retained there. It was not an entirely dark place—there was
light and there was fire. The legends record several instances where spirits of the
dead who had been sent thither were withdrawn from there and brought to the light
and life of the upper world again. Moku-lehua brought his wife Pueo up again from
there. Maluae brought his son Kaalii back from there; the former by the help of his
god Kanikaniula, the latter by that of Kane and Kanaloa; and thus Hiku brought up
the spirit of Kawelu (w.) and revived her.

<h2 class="main">Traditionary Voyages.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During the period in Hawaiian History designated as that of Maweke and Paumakua, which
was about the commencement of the 11th century, or from twenty-eight to thirty generations
ago,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24339src" href="#xd32e24339">1</a> after a period of comparative quiet and obscurity, the Polynesian folk-lore in all
the principal groups becomes replete with the legends and songs of a number of remarkable
men, of bold expeditions, stirring adventures, and voyages undertaken to far-off lands.
An era of national unrest and of tribal commotion seems to have set in from causes
not now known. A migratory wave swept the island world of the Pacific, and left its
traces on the genealogies of the chiefs, in the disuse of old and substitution of
new names for places and landmarks, in the displacement of old, and setting up of
new tutelar gods with enlarged rites of worship and stricter kapus. Chiefs from the
southern groups visited the Hawaiian group, and chiefs from the latter visited the
former, accompanied by their relatives, priests and retainers. Where this ethnic movement
originated,—in the southern groups or in the northern,—it is now hardly possible to
determine. That the Hawaiian group was known at that time to the southern chiefs and
priests, may be shown from the legend of Paao, who, by every concurrent tradition
was a southerner from the Society group, a high-priest of princely blood, and the
founder of one of the high-priest families on Hawaii. In that legend occurs the song
of Paao’s companion, Makuakaumana, a portion of which is still preserved, urging upon
Lonokaeho, another southern chief, to come with them and take possession of Hawaii.
Lonokaeho declined however and sent Pili in his place. That the Hawaii mentioned in
this song is not the Samoan Hawaii, but that of this (Hawaiian) group, becomes evident
by comparing the description of Hawaii in this song with the description given by
Kamahualele, the high-priest of Moikeha, a Hawaiian chief of the same period, who
had resided for many years on the southern groups, but returned to Hawaii and died
on Kauai.
</p>
<p>That the memory of the northern Hawaii should in process of time, and after the cessation
of this period of intercourse, have faded from the minds of southern chiefs and bards,
or been confounded with that of the Samoan Sawaii, is natural enough; though I think
it possible, were Tahitian, Tongan and Samoan legends—if yet existing—properly compared
with each other and with the Hawaiian, that many proofs may yet be drawn from that
side of the frequent intercourse, hostile, or friendly, of those days between the
northern and southern groups of the Pacific.
</p>
<p>Though the northern Hawaii was apparently unknown to the Tonga and Society Islanders
in Captain Cook’s time, yet the Marquesas retained the memory of former intercourse
with that northern Hawaii whose burning mountain, Mounaoa (Maunaloa), is referred
to in some of their songs, but these reminiscences are apparently <span class="pageNum" id="pb339">[<a href="#pb339">339</a>]</span>confused and mixed up with others of that older and far-off Hawaii and Vevao where
they had sojourned before arriving at their own group of islands.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>On October 31, 1527, according to Burney, three vessels left a port called Zivat-Lanejo,
said by Galvoam to be situated in latitude 20 north, on the coast of New Spain, for
the Moluccas or Spice Islands. They were the <i>Florida</i> with fifty men, the <i>St. Jago</i> with forty-five men, and the <i lang="es">Espiritu Santo</i> with fifteen men, under command of Alvaro de Saavedra, with thirty pieces of cannon
and merchandise. These vessels were said to have sailed in company for 1000 leagues<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24358src" href="#xd32e24358">2</a> and then to have been separated by bad weather. The two smaller vessels were never
afterward heard of, and Saavedra pursued the voyage alone. (Burney, <i>Discoveries in the South Seas</i>, I, 147–148.)

<h2 class="main">On the Word Amama.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Lenormant<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24369src" href="#xd32e24369">1</a> says: “All the hymns of the third book finish by the Accadian word <i>Kakama</i>, which is translated in Assyrian by ‘amen,’ ‘<i>amanu</i>.’”
</p>
<p>The prayers of the Hawaiian priests, offered in the temples (heiau) as well as those
offered at private sacred places or in family worship, invariably closed with the
ejaculation <i>amama</i>, equivalent to Amen. In Hawaiian <i>amama</i>, as a verb, means “to offer in sacrifice.” This word does not occur in any of the
other Polynesian dialects that I am acquainted with. It is found then alone as a sacerdotal
expression that may have become obsolete or superseded in the other dialects. It has
no etymon or material foundation within the Polynesian language, and I therefore consider
it to be a foreign word imported into the language in far remote times and from a
people of superior culture, with whom the Polynesians at one time were conterminous
or, in some now unknown way, were connected. That people I believe to have been the
old Accadian Cushites. Fr. Lenormant, in his “<span lang="fr">La langue primitive de la Chaldee</span>” (Paris, 1875) pp. 126 and 271, gives the Accadian <i>kakama</i> as a participle of the verb <i>kaka</i>, “confirmer une parole,” and substantially “confirmation,” “confirme.” As a foreign
word <i>kakama</i> was subject to more or less corruption when passing into the Polynesian language,
and those acquainted with the facility and frequency with which <span class="corr" id="xd32e24403" title="Source: gutterals">gutturals</span> are elided in the Hawaiian, Samoan and some other branches of Polynesian, would easily
recognize the Accadian <i>kakama</i> in the Hawaiian <i>amama</i>. To the Accadians <i>kakama</i> was a regular participle of the verb <i>kaka</i>, meaning “it is confirmed,” and as such was employed at the close of a prayer or
hymn. To the Polynesian (Hawaiian) it was a formula, an ejaculation, employed on similar
occasions in imitation of his teachers, but without any inherent sense derived from
his own language, as multitudes of Christians today use the word <i>amen</i> without knowing its origin or sense. That the Hawaiians employed <i>amama</i> as a verb, “to offer in sacrifice,” I look upon as a later adaption when the primary
sense of the word, if ever known, had been forgotten.

<p class="first">It is evident from the language that iron, or perhaps metal of some sort, was not
unknown to the Polynesians. The Hawaiians had an ancient, now <span class="corr" id="xd32e24424" title="Source: obselete">obsolete</span>, word for iron which was <i>meki</i>; the present term <i>hao</i> is comparatively modern and means any hard substance and, conventionally, iron. But <i>meki</i> is one of those words of wide spread connections which prove its antiquity. We are
justified from the facts in assuming that in naming and defining the various phenomena
of nature, mankind proceeded from generalizations to specifications or, in other words,
it gave a general name to substances of the same nature before it distinguished the
differences between those substances by particular names. Thus all metals probably
received one or more generic names before their differences were noted by specific
individual names. Thus with colors; thus with animals; thus with the body or the most
prominent parts of the body; thus with trees and fruits, etc. Thus language grew from
abstract to concrete terms, and as the primordial races dispersed in tribes and families
they carried with them these generic terms, subject to dialectical differences and
phonetic corruption, and added to them such concrete terms as their mental development
and the circumstances of their new positions might require; and thus in course of
time many or most of the generic <span class="corr" id="xd32e24436" title="Source: synonomous">synonymous</span> words became specific appellations with various tribes. Thus only can I account for
the singular fact that in different sections or tribes of the same race the same word
frequently signifies different objects or ideas, although, when a close analysis is
possible, those objects will generally be found to have been, or were deemed to be,
generally related. For instance, in the Polynesian family of languages, including
the pre-Malay dialect of Malaysia, we find the following apparent confusion of terms:
Rotti, <i>ngeo</i>, black; Batchin, <i>ngoa</i>, black. Hawaii, <i>kea</i>, white, <i>koae</i>, white; North Celebes, <i>kuloh</i>, white; Tidore, <i>kura-chi</i>, yellow. New Zealand, <i>kura</i>, red; Ceram, <i>marah</i>, <i>merah</i>, blue, and <i>poporole</i>, yellow; Hawaii, <i>mele</i>, yellow, and <i>popolo</i>, blue, dark. Thus also in Celebes, <i>bokati</i>; in Buru, <i>boti</i>; in Amblaw, <i>pue</i>, and in Amboyna, <i>pueni</i>, signifies rat. Gilolo, <i>boki</i>; Hawaii, <i>popoki</i>, cat. Buru, <i>babue</i>; Hawaii, <i>puaa</i>; New Zealand, <i>puaka</i>, hog.
</p>
<p>Thus in Irish, <i>baban</i>, child. Arab, <i>babos</i>, the young of either man or beast. Malay, <i>babi</i>, a pig. <i>Baba</i>, father. Celebes, <i>babi-rusa</i>, pig-deer. Sangvir Islands, <i>baba</i>, a monkey. Latin, <i>pupus</i>. Hence the two English words, babe and pup.
</p>
<p>And thus also in the naming of metals, we see that in the Welsh <i>mettel</i> and the Greek <i>metallon</i> the original generic signification of the word metal, or its root, has been retained.
Now let us see the different uses to which this word has been put and the different
changes it has undergone: Hindu (Khol), <i>medh</i>; Hawaiian, <i>meki</i>, iron. Scandinavian, <i>messing</i>; Welsh, pros; Saxon, <i>bros</i>, brass. German, <i lang="de">eisen</i>, iron; <i lang="de">messer</i>, knife. Malay and Javan, <i>besi</i>, <i>busi</i>, <i>bisi</i>; Ethiopian, <i>basal</i>; Celebes, <i>wasy</i>, <i>ase</i>, iron. Latin, <i>aes</i>, copper. Amboyna, <i>pisi-putih</i>, silver (literally “white iron”).
</p>
<p>I look upon the Hindu-Khol and Hawaiian terms as the oldest remaining representatives
<span class="pageNum" id="pb342">[<a href="#pb342">342</a>]</span>of the original root which may have had the compound sound of <i>mb</i>,—<i>mbeki</i>, <i>mbesi</i>—of which different dialects retained one or the other, or discarded both. That the
original idea expressed by that word was metals in general, and not any specific kind
of metal, I consider conclusively shown from the Amboyna term for silver, <i>pisi-putih</i>, meaning literally white iron, as well as from the various specific metals which
the word has been made to designate, such as iron, copper, brass and silver.
</p>
<p>Among the Southern Polynesians, the Rarotongans also had a name for iron. They called
it <i>kurima</i>; but I am unable to trace its linguistic relationship. It may refer to the Gilolo,
<i>kur-achi</i>, the name for gold as well as for yellow. If <i>-achi</i> in <i>kur-achi</i> is a dialectual variation of the Celebes term <i>ase</i> or <i>wasy</i>, then the first syllable represents <i>kura</i>, a Polynesian and pre-Malay word for red, bright, yellow, and thus the compound word
<i>kurachi</i> becomes analogous to the Amboyna <i>pisi-putih</i>, and would signify the red or yellow iron or metal.
</p>
<p>Kolff says, “The Malay language is the <i>lingua franca</i> of the entire Indian Archipelago, but it is only generally understood in those places
which enjoy some commerce. The natives who reside in the mountains, and those who
have no communication with strangers, speak only a dialect of their own.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24579src" href="#xd32e24579">1</a>
</p>
<p>The Malay word <i>ma</i> means mother. Compare the Hawaiian <i>mama</i>, to chew the food for the purpose of feeding children, and the Hawaiian <i>u-ma</i>, now only used in the duplicate form <i>uma-uma</i>, the breast of a female. <i>U</i> itself means breast, what protrudes; hence also <i>ama</i>, satisfied with food. Latin, <i>ma-ma</i>, the breast and mother.
</p>
<p>The Malay <i>ma</i> is probably the oldest form, if not the original meaning, which is better expressed
perhaps in the Latin <i>ma-ma</i>, primarily breast, then mother; also in the Hawaiian <i>u-ma</i>, now obsolete in the simple form, but also meaning the female breast,—a compound
word of which <i>u</i> alone means the breast, what protruded, and <i>ma</i>, which does not occur in the Hawaiian language in that sense, but whose duplicated
form <i>ma-ma</i> means to chew anything with intention of spitting it out again, as <i>awa</i>, and as children were fed. <i>A-ma</i> means satisfied with food. Hebrew, <i>Am</i>, <i>mother</i>; Greek, <i>Amona</i>?
</p>
<p>The Hawaiian <i>mamo</i>, descendants, posterity, grandchildren, etc., derives from the same root. But while
the Malay <i>ma</i> and Java <i>mbo</i> signify “mother,” the composites of these words signify “father” in five-sixths of
the Malay or pre-Malay dialects, while nine-tenths of the same dialects employ the
word <i>hina</i> or <i>ina</i> and its combinations to express the idea of “mother.” The Hawaiian-Polynesian <i>matua</i>, parent, I consider a composite word from the primal <i>ma</i> and the word <i>tua</i>, which in the Sulu dialects signifies “husband,” whatever may have been its original
meaning. In the Hawaiian this word occurs only in composite forms as an epithet of
relationship, as <i>kua-ana</i> the older of two children of the same sex. <i>Kai-ku-nane</i>, “the brother of a sister,” <i>ku</i> probably contracted from <i>kua</i>. <i>Kai-ku-wahine</i>, “the sister of a brother.” The Amboyna and Ceram word for woman “<i>mahina</i>” recurs also in the Hawaiian <i>kai-ka-mahine</i>, “a female descendant, a daughter.” <i>Kai</i> is a generic term of relationship, <i>ka</i> is the article “the” incorporated with the word “<i>mahine</i>” which is but another form of “<i>wa-hine</i>.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb343">[<a href="#pb343">343</a>]</span></p>
<p>The mysterious syllable <i>om</i>, which Manu taught upheld the universe, is shown by Colebrooke to mean “water,” which
was worshiped by the Brahmins as the “immortal fluid,” “the mother of worlds,” etc.
The word recurs in the Egyptian <i>Omphis</i>, a name for Osiris. It is probably also to be found in the Polynesian-Hawaiian <i>amama</i>, equivalent to amen as the end of a prayer, from <i>ama</i>, to offer to the gods; it also means a sacrifice.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hopoe and Haena were two women playing hula in the water off Nanahuki, in Puna.
</p>
<p>Keowahimakaakaua was a brother of Pele.
</p>
<p>In Puupahoehoe, in Kapaahu, in Puna, there is a <i>mawae</i> or rent where Pele slept.
</p>
<p>Pohakuokauai was the <i>kupunakane</i> (grandfather) of Pele and lived at Kaena Point, Oahu.
</p>
<p>At Haena, Kauai, Pele caught Lohiau between Kahuakaiapaoa, his friend, and Mapu, the
music teacher, beating the drum which had disturbed her sleep.
</p>
<p>Pele took Lohiau for her husband and returned to Hawaii, promising to send for him.
Lohiau hung himself from chagrin at Pele’s leaving him.
</p>
<p>Pele sent Hiiaka to bring Lohiau. Hiiaka started on her travel, quarreled with and
killed Panaewa, fell in with Wahineomao and made her her friend, killed Makaeekiu
off Waipio, and fell in with Mokulau or Moolau from Kohala.
</p>
<p>Kaipalaoa (k.) and Punahoa (w.) were the parents of Wahineomao.
</p>
<p>Piliamoo and Nohoamao, of Hilo, who owned the “<i lang="haw">papa kahulihuli o Wailuku</i>,” were killed by Hiiaka.
</p>
<p>Unihipili was the name of a god at Honolii, in Hilo.
</p>
<p>Piikea nui refused passage in his canoe to Hiiaka and was swamped. On Molokai, Hiiaka
killed Ilole (w.) and Hoolehua (w.) because they were jealous of her.
</p>
<p>Ulamawao was the name of a pali on Oahu and the name of one of Pele’s husbands.
</p>
<p>Makapuu, Kekuapololi and Malei, the husband of Kanahau, living in Koolau, were relations
of Hiiaka.
</p>
<p>Makapuu was the wife of Kekuapololi. Pohakuloa, in or above Waimanalo was another
personage Hiiaka met.
</p>
<p>At Kapua in Koolau Muliwaiolena and her daughter Apuakea were killed because the latter
compared herself to Hiiaka in beauty.
</p>
<p>At Kailua, Hiiaka went to see the country and found Hauwahine bathing. When she perceived
Hiiaka, her bird flew up and obscured the sun (an eclipse). She next fell in with
Mahinui and Keaalau who were bewailing the death of their child Hanalua. Olomana and
Auliilii are mountain peaks in Koolau. Pueo, a chief in Kaalaea, made war on Hiiaka
and was killed.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb344">[<a href="#pb344">344</a>]</span></p>
<p>From Hakipuu, going <i>mauka</i> (inland), because the pali projected in the sea, Hiiaka found and killed Mokolii,
a <i>moo</i> (lizard), cut off his tail and threw it in the sea and hence the island of Mokolii,
near Kualoa. His body formed the lowland <i>makai</i> (towards the sea), below the <i>pali</i> of Kualoa.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Palani was chief of Kahana. Iewale was his wife, killed by Hiiaka while bathing. Kauhiikemaokalani
was a person and a mountain peak near Kaliuwaa in Koolau.—In his greeting to Hiiaka
he called Pele and her family “<i lang="haw">na akua malihini</i>.”
</p>
<p>Punahoolapa and Pahipahialua near Kahuku.
</p>
<p>Hopoe, the friend of Hiiaka, was destroyed by Pele during Hiiaka’s absence.
</p>
<p>Piliaaama was fishing off Waimea (“<i lang="haw">kanaka lawaia o ka pali</i>”).—He was <i lang="haw">Konohiki</i> to Ihukoko.—He was also a “<i lang="haw">kane hii alo</i>” (bosom companion) of Kapuewai.
</p>
<p>Kekuohapuu, in the upland west of Waimea, Koolau.—Lahuimoho and Wawaemoho were gods
on top of Kaala mountain.
</p>
<p>Malaehaakoa and his wife Wailuanuiahoino lived at Haena, Kauai; he was a grandson
of Kanoalani.
</p>
<p>Pele quarreled in Kahiki with Puna-ai-koae and fled from there to Hawaii.
</p>
<p>Limaloa, Kaunalewa and Mana were brothers of Lohiau. Kahuanui was one of his sisters.
</p>
<p>Aka and Kilioe were two women who watched over the cave where Lohiau was interred.
They were killed by Hiiaka.
</p>
<p>It being near night when Hiiaka arrived at the pali where Lohiau was buried, she called
on the sun to stand still, “<i lang="haw">i ka muli o Hea</i>,” until she could climb the pali, and the sun listened to her prayer.
</p>
<p>When Hiiaka brought Lohiau to life she invoked the aid of Kuhulu the <i lang="haw">akua</i>. Is that the Samoan Kuhuruhuru, according to New Zealand tradition, a son of Hinauri
and Kinirau?
</p>
<p>Other gods invoked on that occasion were Kuwaa, Kuhailimoku, Kanaloa, Kahaula, Kaoaka,
Kapaulaula, Kapaeleele, Kapaahu, Lonomakua, Keoaahimakaakaua, Kanekapolei, Kane, Laka
(the husband of Haiwahine).
</p>
<p>Nakoaola was the man of Kahuanui (w.).
</p>
<p>Kahuakaipaoa was chief of that part of Kauai and went with all his men to Niihau.
</p>
<p>Returning with Lohiau from Kauai, Hiiaka visited Oahu and greeted all the principal
mountain peaks on the Kona side.
</p>
<p>At Honolulu (Kou) Hiiaka stopped at the house of Peleula.
</p>
<p>Olepau was a king of Maui in Hiiaka’s time.
</p>
<p>Kaweloikaiehuehu and Waihinalo were Olepau’s wives.
</p>
<p>Kapo lived on Maui and was elder sister of Hiiaka.—She is also called Kapomailele.
</p>
<p>Kapo and Puanui brought up Wahinano and gave her as a wife to Olepau. She is called
“<i lang="haw">Wahinano wahine a Kapoipoi</i>.”—Olepau and Ole, the same.—When Olepau died he gave his kingdom to his youngest
brother Kaumuleialii.—Makaiwa and Kaakau were also brothers of Olepau.

<p class="first">Hainakolo was the sister of Olopana, wife of Keaniniulaokalani. Olopana had two daughters,
Luukia-nui and Luukia-iki.
</p>
<p>Hainakolo’s sons, called Lopaikihelewale, was fished up from the sea and brought up
by Luukia-nui. Olopana’s place was Opaelolo.
</p>
<p>Lopa’s proper name was Leimakani. At this time Kumunuiaiweke and Moanonuikalehua were
“<i lang="haw">kanaka hoe waa</i>” (canoe paddlers) of Keauniniulaokalani.
</p>
<p>Leimakani became the husband of Luukia-iki,—scene near Waipio, Hawaii.
</p>
<p>The island of Pae was to leeward, or <i lang="haw">ilalo</i> of Kuaihelani.
</p>
<p>Luukia-nui took Leimakani from her sister and had by him a child, called Lonokaiolohia
(k.), who was killed by <span class="corr" id="xd32e24798" title="Source: Luukai-nui">Luukia-nui</span> in a jealous fit.—“<i lang="haw">Hainakolo, wahine i ka pali o Waipio.</i>” Keanini had another wife, Kaekaenalukai, in Kuaihelani. Lonokaiolohia was restored
to life again by Hainakolo and Keanini committed suicide from grief over Hainakolo’s
leaving him and going to Hawaii.

<h2 class="main">Things Similar in India, etc., and Polynesia.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">How far any distinct remembrance of the Siwa worship may be traced in Polynesian traditions
and customs is not easy to determine precisely. The blood-thirsty wife of Siwa still
survives in name and attributes in the Tongan God of War, Kaliai-tu-po. The name itself
of Siwa recurs in the Polynesian word Hiwa, primarily “dark colored, black or blue;”
secondarily, “sacred,” as a sacrificial offering. In different dialects the word occurs
as Siwa, Hiwa, or Heiwa, and is applied as an adjective with derivative meanings,
but in all the idea of sacredness underlies and characterizes its application. Thus
Nuka-Hiwa, one of the Marquesas, undoubtedly meant originally the dark or sacred island;
Fatu-Hiwa or Patu-Hiwa, another of the same group, meant the “sacred rock or stone;”
Hiwaoa, still another of the same group, meant “very sacred or holy.” In Hawaiian
<i>puaa-hiwa</i> means the “black or sacred hog” offered in sacrifices. <i>Hiwa-hiwa</i> was an epithet applied to gods and high chiefs. The name of the Siwaite <i>Lingam</i>, the symbol of productiveness, has unquestionably its root and derivation from the
same source as the Tongan word <i>linga</i>, which means the male organ of generation, and the primary sense of the word which
is found in the Hawaiian <i>lina</i>, “soft, yielding,” as <i>papa lina</i>, cheek; New Zealand and Samoan <i>ta-ringa</i>, ear, <i>et al</i>.
</p>
<p>What the Hawaiians called <i lang="haw">pohaku a kane</i>, upright stones of from one to six and eight feet in height, the smaller size portable
and the larger fixed in the ground, and which formerly served as altars or places
of offering at what may be called family worship, probably referred to the Lingam
symbolism of the Siwa cult in India,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25129src" href="#xd32e25129">1</a> where similar stone pillars, considered as sacred, still abound.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25139src" href="#xd32e25139">2</a>
</p>
<p>But Siwa, as before observed, was not a Vedic god, and his rites were held in abomination
by the earlier Vedic Aryans. These stone symbols refer, therefore, to a period of
pre-Aryan occupation of India and to the Cushite civilization or race. In the Hawaiian
group these stone pillars were sprinkled with water or <span class="corr" id="xd32e25148" title="Source: annointed">anointed</span> with coconut oil, and the upper part frequently covered with a black native <i>kapa</i> or cloth, the color of garment which priests wore on special occasions, and which
was also the cloth in which the dead were wrapped.…

<p>It is possible that from these or similar considerations of superiority of sacredness
arose the Polynesian proverb (in Hawaiian), <i lang="haw">he weo ke kanaka, he pano ke alii</i>, red is the common man, dark is the chief.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25158src" href="#xd32e25158">3</a>

<p>The emblem of Siwa, in Hindu mythology, is the double trident. On the hill called
Kaulanahoa, back of Kalae, Molokai, of the Hawaii group, are a number of singularly
shaped volcanic stones, standing on the brow of the hill, amongst which is one marked
with a double trident <span class="figure xd32e25166width"><img src="images/trident.png" alt="double trident" width="58" height="52"></span> in two places.
</p>
<p>Jos. Roberts (<i>Oriental Illustrations</i>, London, 1835) makes the following observations: To look back after leaving a house
or to be called after, was an unfortunate sign in India and in Hawaii (p. 22). “In
India, as in Polynesia, salutations between people are made by smelling of each other,”
(p. 32). And “whenever a favor has to be solicited, peace made or an interview desired,
presents are always sent before. On Hawaii and elsewhere in Polynesia presents always
accompanied the visitor or were sent before,” (p. 39). “In India priests and people
shave the head, leaving only a tuft on the crown. In Hawaii the heads were frequently
shaven so as to leave only a ridge or crest on the top of the head” (p. 91). “Shaving
the head is a sign of mourning common in the East as well as among the Polynesians—also
among the Arabs, according to Herodotus,” (p. 471). “In India tatooing, by puncturing
the skin, is practiced. Tatooing prevails throughout Polynesia.” (p. 91). “An unhealthy
country is said to ‘eat up the inhabitants,’ a victorious or oppressive rajah is said
to ‘eat up the country’. In Hawaii the expression <i>ai-moku</i>, ‘eating up the land,’ is an epithet of chiefs. The expression ‘to live in the shadow’
of another is common. So also in Hawaii” (p. 101). “To propose riddles and hard questions
for solution at entertainments in India is a common amusement. Such custom obtained
also in Hawaii when chiefs entertained each other” (p. 199). “The sacred groves, or
trees, invariable accessories of India temples and sacred places, have their counterpart
in most of the Polynesian heiaus and morais; the sacred <i>aoa</i> tree in Raiatea, Society Islands. Females in India eat apart from their husbands
or men generally. Under the Hawaiian <i>kapu</i> system females not only ate apart, but were also forbidden many kinds of food of
which men ate freely” (p. 255).
</p>
<p>“Nearly all the females (of India) wore jewels of gold in their nostrils, or in the
septum of the nose. In Hawaii this custom was not in use, but in other parts of Polynesia
it was customary to have a ring or a bone inserted in the septum” (p. 367).

<p>“The Hawaiian sooth-sayers or <i>kilokilo</i> turned to the north when observing the heavens for signs and omens. So did the ancient
Hindus: so did the Iranians before the schism, when they placed the Divas in the north;
so did the Greeks; so did the ancient Scandinavians before their conversion to Christianity.”
“Hawaiians turned to the west when naming the cardinal points, <span class="corr" id="xd32e25187" title="Source: Ayrans">Aryans</span> to the east. With the former, left was south.” (Excerpts from Pictet, Vol. II.)
</p>
<p>According to the researches of J. Grimm (<i lang="de">Über das Verbrennen der Leichen</i>), all the Aryan peoples, with one exception, practiced incremation at their funerals
from time immemorial, in place of interment. The Indians, Greeks, Romans, Gauls, Ancient
Germans, Lithuanians and Slavs during heathen times, burned their dead with ceremonies
which present evident traces of resemblance, notwithstanding their diversity. The
Iranians alone at an early time abandoned this ancient custom on account of the radical
difference which arose in their religious creed. The Hebrews and Arabs never practiced
incremation (p. 504). The Egyptian Cushites practiced embalming. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb349">[<a href="#pb349">349</a>]</span>Polynesians never followed incremation, they practiced exposure and preserved the
bones of the dead, or a species of embalming and interment in caves. Did they separate
from the Iranian branch after the schism, or did they follow the training and customs
received from the Cushite teachings?
</p>
<p>“The Polynesians like the ancient Aryans divided the night into four portions” (p.
591). “The Hindus call the last night of the old moon, in Sanskrit, <i>kuhu</i> (<i>la lune caché</i>), and <i>amaoasi</i>, dwelling with (the sun). The Hawaiians called the 30th day [of the] month, and the
Tahitians the 29th day, <i>muku</i>, cut off, shortened, ceased” (p. 598).
</p>
<p><i>Warua</i> (Tah.) and <i>wailua</i> (Haw.), spirit, ghost, have phonetic resemblance to Vedic Sanskrit <i>Varuna</i>, one of the oldest Vedic deities. It is not improbable however that “<i>Varuna</i>” derives from <i>warua</i>. The Polynesian word is evidently a composite, but as it does not occur in the other
dialects, so far as I know, or in a different form, I am unable to analyze it. The
Sanskrit <i>Varuna</i>, however, which is so confidently ascribed to the root <i>or</i>, var., to cover, surround, may by consulting the Polynesian remnant of Old-world
languages, be found to differently and equally appropriately refer itself to the Polynesian
<i>wa</i>, span, and <i>runa</i> or <i>luna</i>, above.
</p>
<p>“The ancient Aryans distinguished three heavenly regions, 1st, the upper heavens,
<i>Dio</i>; 2d, the heaven of clouds, <i>Nabhas</i>; and 3d, the atmosphere, <i>Autariksha</i> (transparent)” (p. 665). “The Polynesians had the distinction of three heavens, viz:
that of Kane, Ku, Lono. Of origin of fire, E. Aryan and W. Aryan” (p. 679).
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The ancient inhabitants of Yemen worshiped and canonized their ancestors.
</p>
<p>Polyandry in Arabia, as mentioned by Strabo, was of Cushite origin, as well as the
community of goods between brothers under the administration of the eldest, still
practiced by the Narikas of Malabar, and the remnants of the primitive populations
of ante-Aryan India. (Lenormant, Vol. II, p. 318.)
</p>
<p>There is one custom which, practiced by the Polynesians, was opposed to Hebrew or
Egyptian; viz., the feeding on swine’s flesh and rearing them for food as well as
for sacrifice to the gods. (See Rawlinson’s <i>Herodotus</i>, II, 47, n. 5.)
</p>
<p>In Egyptian hieroglyphics the negative sign is a pair of extended arms with the hands
downward, preceding the verb. The mute but emphatic negative of the Hawaiian is expressed
by turning the hand over with the palm downward.
</p>
<p>The Egyptians were permitted to marry their sisters by the same father and mother.
And in patriarchal times a man was permitted to marry a sister, the daughter of his
father only. (Rawlinson, <i>Herodotus</i>, III, 32, n. 1.) Among Hawaiian chiefs such marriages gave additional rank and exalted
position to the offspring—to the children of Keawe and Kalanikaula, for example.
</p>
<p>The custom of sacrificing their first prisoner (in war) is ascribed by Procopius to
the Thulite or Scandinavians. (Bell. Goth. II. 15; Rawlinson’s <i>Herodotus</i>, VII, 180, n. 4.)
</p>
<p>An ancient Hawaiian legend runs as follows (Polynesian Race, Vol. I, p. 99): Kealii-Wahanui
was the king of the country called “Honua-i-lalo.” He oppressed the Lahui Menehune.
Their God Kane sent Kane Apua and Kanaloa, his elder brother, to <span class="pageNum" id="pb350">[<a href="#pb350">350</a>]</span>bring this people away from there and take them to the land which Kane had given them
and which was called Ka Aina Momona a Kane, or with another name Ka One Lauena a Kane,
or with still another name Ka Aina i ka Houpo a Kane. They were then told to observe
the four Ku days in the beginning of the month as <i>kapu hoano</i> in remembrance of this, because then they arose (ku) to depart from that land. The
offerings were swine and sheep. (The narrator of this legend says that there were
formerly sheep without horns on the slopes of Maunaloa, Hawaii, and that they were
there up to the time of Kamehameha I, and he refers to some account published by a
foreigner in 1787.) The legend further says that after leaving the land of bondage,
they came to the Kai Ula a Kane, were pursued by “Ke Alii Wahanui,” that Kane Apua
and Kanaloa prayed to Lono, and they then waded across the sea, traveled through the
desert and finally reached the Aina Lauena a Kane! This was kept as the first <i>kapu hoano</i> of the year.
</p>
<p>On first receiving this legend, I was inclined to doubt its genuineness and to consider
it as a paraphrase and adaptation of the Biblical account, by some semi-civilized
or semi-Christianized Hawaiian after the discovery of the group by Cook. But a further
and better acquaintance with Hawaiian folk-lore has shown me that, though the details
of the legend, as narrated by the Christian and civilized Kamakau, may possibly in
some degree, and unconsciously perhaps, have received a Biblical coloring, yet the
main facts of the legend, with the identical names of places and persons, are referred
to in other legends of undoubted antiquity. I am compelled therefore to class this
legend among the other Chaldeo-Arabic-Hebraic mementos which the Polynesians brought
with them from their ancient homesteads in the west. And it is possible that the legend
was preserved in after times by the priesthood, as offering a rational explanation
of the institution of the <i>kapu</i> days of Ku. Another feature attests the genuine antiquity of the legend, viz. that
no other gods are referred to than those primordial ones of Hawaiian theogony; Kane,
Ku and Lono, the latter of whom is clearly recognized as the god of the atmosphere,
of air and water, the Lono-noho-i-ka-wai of the creation chants.

<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Island of <i>Baba</i>, south of the Banda group, Indian Archipelago, is probably the protonome of Vawa,
in the western part of the Fiji group; viz., <i>Oto-vawa</i>, and <i>Ka-vawa</i>, and the <i>Wiwa</i> and <i>Wawa</i> in Hawaiian legends.
</p>
<p>The islanders of Baba and Tepa and adjoining islands rub lime into their hair, by
which the natural blackness changes to reddish, flaxen color. In Polynesia (Hawaii)
it was common practice to rub lime into the hair, whereby it became <i>ehu</i> (red) and sometimes entirely white.
</p>
<p>Tepa, a village on Baba, corresponds to Kepa, a land on Kauai, Hawaiian group.
</p>
<p>Aluta, name of a village or district on the Island of Baba. At Baba large canoes are
called <i>orang baay</i>. Polyn. <i>waa</i>, <i>waha</i>.
</p>
<p>At the Aru Islands the eastern portion is called the back of the islands. A similar
expression obtains in the Hawaiian group.
</p>
<p>S.&nbsp;A. Walkenaer (<i>Monde Maritime</i>, Vol. I,) states that <i>Orangkayas</i> was the name of the Noblesse in Achim, Sumatra. Rangatera in the Society group were
the free-holders or the lower class of chiefs (p. 21). “One of the Districts in the
Batta Country of <span class="pageNum" id="pb351">[<a href="#pb351">351</a>]</span>Sumatra is called Ankola.” Anahola name of one district in Kauai. (Phonetic corruption?<span class="corr" id="xd32e25306" title="Not in source">)</span> (p. 28.) “In the Batta Country each village has a <i>Bale</i> or place of reunion of the inhabitants;”—“Whale” in New Zealand, “Fale” in Samoa,
“Hale” in Hawaii (p. 35).
</p>
<p>“<i>Saka</i> was a surname of Buddha. In the Japanese annals Saka lived 1000 years B.C. and the
religion of Japan is that of Saka or Siaka. Whence the name Hiaka or Hika in the Hawaiian
mythology? Saka is a Sanscrit word signifying era or epoch, and was used as a surname
for several celebrated monarchs and founders of dynasties in India.
</p>
<p>“On the other hand the Sovereigns of Guzzerat in India bore, during the 7th century
A.D., the title of <i>Diva-Saka</i> or <i>Di-Saka</i> (pp. 225, 226). What connection with Hiaka?
</p>
<p>“The Malay race expanded from Sumatra to Malaka, and not vice versa. The original
country of the Malays (according to their own traditions) was Palembang (the kingdom
of) in Sumatra, called the island of <i>Indalous</i>. They lived near the river <i>Malayo</i>, which descends from the mountain <i>Maha-Merou</i>. In 1160 A.D. under <i>Sri-Touri-Bouwana</i> they invaded and conquered the Peninsular of Malacca which was then called Oudjong-Tanah,
or the land of Oudjong. The Malays were then called Orang de bavah angen, or people
of, or toward the South.
</p>
<p>“Other Malay historians trace the origin of the people to Hindustan. They trace their
chiefs up to Alexander the Great or Rajah Sekander. One of the sons of Rajah Souren,
founder of Besnagour in India conquered Palembang in Sumatra and founded an empire.
About the year 1159 the Palembang chiefs invaded Java.” (pp. 41–43.)
</p>
<p>Turner’s <i>Nineteen Years in Polynesia</i>, gives the following Samoan traditions:
</p>
<p><i>Origin of Fire.</i> Mafuie, the god of earthquakes, lived under the earth and kept a constant fire. Talanga
used to go down to Mafuie’s place through a rock, singing out: “Rock divide, I am
Talanga.” His son Tiitii found out his secret, descended and got some fire from Mafuie,
but when he had lighted his oven Mafuie blew it up and blew out the fire. Tiitii then
went down for more, fought Mafuie, broke off his right arm and obtained fire, Mafuie
telling him to find it in every wood he cut.
</p>
<p>Savage island has a similar tradition, changing the names of Talanga and Tiitii into
“<i>Maui</i>” (father) and “<i>Maui</i>” (son).
</p>
<p><i>Cosmogony.</i> In the beginning the earth was covered with water and the heaven alone inhabited.
Tangaloa, the great god, sent his daughter in the form of the bird <i>kuri</i> (snipe) to look for dry land. She found a spot, and as it was extending, she visited
it frequently. At one time she brought down some earth and a creeping plant. The plant
grew, decomposed and turned into worms, and the worms turned into men and women.
</p>
<p>Another account says that Tangaloa rolled two great stones down from heaven, one became
the island of Sawaii, the other, Upolo.
</p>
<p>Of old the heavens fell down and people had to crawl about. The plants grew and pushed
the heavens up a little from the earth. The place where this happened is called <i>Te’enga-langi</i> and is thus pointed out. One day a man came along and offered <span class="pageNum" id="pb352">[<a href="#pb352">352</a>]</span>to push the heavens up for a drink of water from a woman’s gourd. He did so and got
the water. Another account calls the man’s name Tiitii.
</p>
<p><i>About the Moon.</i> Two men <i>Punifanga</i> and <i>Tafaliu</i> started to visit the moon. The former thought to reach it by climbing a tree; the
latter kindled a large fire, raised a great column of smoke, and climbed up to the
moon on that, and got there long before the other.
</p>
<p>A woman named Sina, during famine time, seeing the moon rising one evening wished
a bite of it. The moon grew indignant and came down and picked her up, her child,
her tapa board and mallet, and there they have remained until this day and are plainly
to be seen.
</p>
<p><i>About the Sun.</i> A woman called Mangamangai became pregnant by looking at the sun. Her son, called
child of the sun, climbed a tree and with a rope and noose caught the sun one morning
and obtained from him a basket of blessings. Another account says that he and his
mother were annoyed at the sun’s going so fast; so, after having caught the sun with
his rope, he stipulated as a condition of liberating the sun, that it should travel
slower after that, which has been duly performed.
</p>
<p>The god of the lower regions was called Feé.
</p>
<p>Raho and Iwa walked from Samoa on the sea until they came where Rotuma is. Raho had
a basket of earth and of it made the island.
</p>
<p><i>Taro.</i> A person called Lasi went up to heaven and brought the taro down on earth and planted
it there.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>1. The New Zealand legends treat of four other names borne in the Hawaiian genealogy
as living in Hawaiki before the exodus to New Zealand; viz., <i>Hema</i>, <i>Tawhaki</i> (Kahai), <i>Wahieroa</i> and <i>Raka</i> (Laka).
</p>
<ul>
<li>Hema and his wife Urutonga begat Tawhaki and Kariki.
</li>
<li>Tawhaki and Hine piripiri begat Wahieroa.
</li>
<li>Wahieroa and Kura begat Raka.
</li>
<li>Raka and Tongarautawhiri begat Tuwhakararo.
</li>
<li>Tuwhakararo and Apukura begat Whakatau.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>2. Another tradition says that Maui-a-Taoanga had a sister named Hina-uri, and makes
the following pedigree:
</p>
<p>Hinauri (w.) and Tinirau (k.) begat Tuhuruhuru.
</p>
<p>Tuhuruhuru and Apakura (w.) begat Tu-whakararo, Mairatea (w.), Whakataupotiki, and
Reimatua.
</p>
<p>3. The Ngati paoa tribe’s chiefs, in 1853, counted fifteen generations from and with
Hotunui who came from Hawaiki with the first settlers in New Zealand in the canoe
Tainui, companion to Arawa. Average thirty years to a generation = 450 years—1400
or thereabouts. (Sir Geo. Grey’s Polynesian Mythology.)
</p>
<p>The proper trade wind at Tahiti is from east-southeast to east-northeast and is called
<i>Maarai</i>. When the wind is to south of southeast it is called <i>Maoai</i>. The west northwest and northwest wind is called <i>Toerau</i>. If still more northerly it is <i>Era-potaia</i>, the wife of Toerau. The wind from southwest and west-southwest is called <i>E-toa</i>, if still more southerly it is called <i>Farua</i>. (Cook’s Voy., Vol. 2, p. 143.)

<p>Uru-tae-tae was the Tahitian god who conducted departed spirits, for whom the priests
of Roma-tane were employed, to the place of happiness.
</p>
<p>Tali-ai-tubu. The principal god of the Tongas. God of war. Is that a namesake or transfer
of the blood-thirsty Indian goddess <i>Kali</i> or Patra-Kali, the wife of Siwa?
</p>
<p>“The Tahitian god <i>Oro</i> was called <i>Koro</i> in Raiatea. The Atituakians say they came from Awaiki, Tetarewa being the first.
Awaiki was below. Tetarewa climbed up from it.
</p>
<p>“The chief Makea at Rarotonga in 1840 was the twenty-ninth descendant from Karika,
or Makea Karika, who came from Manuka or Manua, one of the Samoan group. He fell in
at sea with Tangiia, a chief from Faaa in Tahiti. Tangiia made submission and the
two went to Rarotonga and settled there.” (Missionary Enterprises, Rev. J. Williams,
Ch. XIII.)
</p>
<p>Ruanuu—Luanuu, a chief at Raiatea, left that island and settled at Aitutaki. Conductor
of fleets; his genealogy kept up at Aitutaki. (Id., Ch. VII.)
</p>
<p>In Tahiti the <i>vaa</i> were: <i>vaa-mataaina</i>, double canoes belonging to principal chiefs and public districts, fifty, sixty or
seventy feet long; three or four feet deep. Stern ornamented with <i>tii</i>; then the <i>pahi</i> or war canoe, double, from sixty to one hundred feet long, three to four feet deep.
The <i>vaa-tii</i>, sacred canoes, similar.
</p>
<p>Common double canoe, <i>tipairua</i>.—Haw. <i>kaulua</i>.
</p>
<p>Another kind of double canoe was called <i>maihi</i>, or twins, made from single trees, the others were sewed together from pieces of
<i>tamanu</i> or other wood.
</p>
<p>The <i>vaa-motu</i> (Island canoe) single, built for sailing, has washboards. All single canoes are provided
with outriggers (<i>ama</i>) fixed on the left side.
</p>
<p>The Paumotu canoes are much larger and stronger then the Tahitian ones. One from Rurutu
had twelve feet depth of hold.
</p>
<p><i>Tii</i> in Tahitian means spirit of the dead.
</p>
<p>Tiimaaraauta and Tiimaaraatai were the first human beings at Opoa in Raiatea, whence
they spread over the group. The latter is sometimes called Hina.
</p>
<p>Rua-hatu, the Tahitian Neptune, being asleep in the depth of the ocean, a fisherman
of Raiatea dropped his hooks in the hair of Rua-hatu. Enraged, he came up and threatened
to destroy the world. The fisherman <i>mihi’d</i> (apologized), and was told to go <span class="pageNum" id="pb354">[<a href="#pb354">354</a>]</span>and fetch his wife and child, and to repair to Toamarama, an island near Raiatea.
He did so, took wife, child and a friend, and a pig, a dog and pair of fowls. The
waters then rose and covered Raiatea and all the rest of the world, but these four
alone were saved.
</p>
<p>The Afghans have a tradition that only seven persons were saved from the deluge.
</p>
<p>Old Arab traditions give two sons to Seth, viz. Enoch and Sabi. They also relate that
Noah had one son who perished in the flood with his mother Waela. The Mexicans, according
to Humboldt report also only seven persons saved from the flood.
</p>
<p>The Marquesans have eight persons saved.
</p>
<p>In 1625 was found in Si-quan-Fou, in the Province of Chen-Si, in China, a dark colored
marble slab with an inscription, detailing the arrival of the Christian (Nestorian)
missionaries there from Ta-Thsin (Persia or Syria or west of Asia), its founder was
called Olopen (what relation to the Hawaiian Olopana?). In the inscription God is
called Oloho, supposed a corruption of the Syrian Eloha. (What relation has this word
to the name of the Tahitian god Olo, or to the Hawaiian name for God’s residence Olo-loi-mehani?)
</p>
<p>In Chinese language “<i>Wan-Ou</i>”—ten thousand things, is an expression for the totality of created beings. In Polynesian
language Wanua or Wenua means the earth and all it contains.
</p>
<p>In the inscription the Christian religion is called King-Khiao, literally, luminous
religion. In Hawaiian mythology when Ku, Kane and Lono created man their invocation
was Hi-ki-ao-ola. Any connection?

of tatooing with which the bodies of the chiefs were adorned. As late as the time
of Kamehameha I. of Hawaii, his rival Kahekili, King of Maui, had one-half of his
body entirely blackened by tatooing.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e25158src" title="Return to note 3 in text.">↑</a></p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In confirmation of the Polynesian connection with the Aryan stock, at a very early
period, I will refer to the numeral systems of both. I believe that it is now pretty
well established that the more ancient and rude a people is or was, the more limited
is or was its numeral system. The Australians to this day do not count beyond three
or four. The wooly-haired <i>indigènes</i> of the peninsula of Malacca count only to two. One is <i>nai</i>, and two is <i>be</i>. The latter calls strongly to mind the Basque <i>bi</i> and the Latin <i lang="la">bis</i>, two. The Dravidian languages exhibit signs, by the composition of their higher numbers,
that at one time the range of their numerals was equally limited. The Polynesian language
gives undoubted evidence that at one time the people who spoke it did not count beyond
four, and that its ideas of higher numbers were expressed by multiples of four.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25589src" href="#xd32e25589">2</a> They evidently counted one, two, three, four, and that amount called “<i>kau-na</i>” was their tally, when the process was repeated again. That the same system obtained
in the Aryan family in early times is evident not only from the marked relationship
between the four first Aryan and Polynesian numbers, but the method of counting by
fours as a tally still obtains among some of the Aryan descendants.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25603src" href="#xd32e25603">3</a>
</p>
<p>The following table will show the relation I am seeking to establish. It is selected
equally from Aryan and Polynesian branches; but there is this to be observed that,
while the latter in all probability exhibit the archaic form of the language, the
former exhibit a comparatively later and more or less modified form of the same.

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e27122src">1</a></span> Kaleikuahulu was a person of ingenuity. He was a chief, a priest, a diviner, a counselor,
the king’s genealogist, and a renowned poet who composed many songs. He was a grandson
of Keawe, King of Hawaii, and the son of Kumukoa, King of Molokai. He was born at
Kainalu on Molokai in the year 1725, when Kalanikuihonoikamoku was King of Maui, and
Kanealii his grandmother was chiefess of Molokai. He lived for some time on Oahu and
on Kauai, when Kaiana and Namakeha lived with Kamehameha on Hawaii. Kaleikuahulu also
lived on Hawaii with Kamehameha, who appointed certain of his chiefs to learn from
Kaleikuahulu the genealogy of kings.

L. Andrews which enrich this collection, nor has a copy been found. The version in
Vol. IV of these Memoirs, pp. 13–17, credited to Pakui, resembles it in part.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e27122src" title="Return to note 1 in text.">↑</a></p>

XII, the translation and its copious notes is the work of Judge Andrews. All revisions
have been made with care to do justice to the work of so profound an Hawaiian scholar,
yet with reluctance, from the apparent presumption. Judge S.&nbsp;B. Dole expressed himself
similarly in his giving publicity for the first time to the translation of cantos
I to IX (inclusive) of this chant in the <i>Islander</i>, in 1875. Three other cantos (X, XI and XII) were referred to at that time but were
held for revision and only now <span class="corr" id="xd32e28233" title="Source: sees">see</span> print. Since then three additional cantos (XIII, XIV, and XV) are found in the version
of “<span lang="haw">Haui ka Lani</span>” published in King Kalakaua’s “<span lang="haw">Mele Aimoku</span>” collection of 1886, and are embodied here for completion, translated by the editor
of these Memoirs, with the aid of J.&nbsp;P. Kuluwaimaka, a famed chanter. The notes of
the larger portion particularly refer to the Hawaiian version, and, as formulated
by Judge Andrews, will be found to throw much light on ancient thought and usage,
as also interpretations of many obsolete terms.—<span class="sc">Editor</span>.]&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e28229src" title="Return to note 1 in text.">↑</a></p>

this was thought to imply a dusty section of country, in passing through which one
would literally bathe in dust, as the saying is. Not having had such an experience
in our travels through Kaù, it was evident that some characteristic of the district
was used here by the poet to belittle his opponents. Research revealed the following:
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">At Paiehaa, not far distant from Kaalualu, in olden time was a dust-pit known by the
name of Kaumaia, that was famous as a sport place for the youth of the district and
even their elders, into which they would leap from the side cliff, some ten or twelve
feet high, and flounder about in its dust as if splashing around in a bathing pool.
Tradition hath it that its dust was credited with possessing remedial qualities and
became in more recent years an asset to certain of the kahuna class. One such, on
Kauai, directed a patient to go to Kaù and leap into the dust-pit of Kaumaia, which
resulted in the poor dupe breaking both his legs in his jump.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e37328src" title="Return to note 619 in text.">↑</a></p>

which all agree includes the <i lang="haw">amama</i> or amen. One veteran said it was used only in sincere prayers to which <span lang="haw">amama</span> only belonged. Another held that it expressed fervency in the petitioner. That it
evinces a feeling of awe, as used here, is recognized in the accompanying <i lang="haw">kau mai</i>, o’rshadow, or possess me. It also means entirely, profoundly.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e51759src" title="Return to note 2 in text.">↑</a></p>

Creation chant of a few years earlier, and may have been influenced thereby, the original
